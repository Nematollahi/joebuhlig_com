I didn't want to write this post. I don't want you to read it. My wife wanted me to write it. I hesitated. Writing it forces me to admit that I'm picky and maybe neurotic. So it's probably a good thing that I did write it.

I work from home full-time, so it's imperative that I have a workspace that is my own. I work from our family room. There's a fireplace, a bathroom, and an awesome sectional that's great for naps. It also has a closet.

# The closet

It's a couple feet deep with bi-fold doors on it. I put a desk and some shelves inside the closet and turned it into an office. I can close the doors and make it all disappear. It's pretty slick.

# The original setup

My powerhouse, the Mac Pro, was sitting off to the right hand side of the monitors. As you can imagine, cords are a nightmare. I found a way to feed the cords down below the desk and keep them organized. It was a lot of work to do it that way, but it's clean.

# My completely understandable problem

I began to have rogue gadgets. I have an external disc drive (that I almost never use) and a 7 port USB hub. I also began to plug more and more things into the tower itself. Off to the right hand side of my keyboard and mouse, I also had a notepad and my phones and my pens and notecards and… you get the idea. On the left side all I had was a set of headphones and a cup of coffee. Issue: _I'm right-handed_.

# My brilliant solution

I'm no brain surgeon but I could see that I had to do something here. I was piling everything on the right side–the area I always wanted to use for taking notes or pretty much anything else.

I moved the tower over to the left, which sounds a lot easier than it was. I use three computer monitors and they come with lots of cords. I had to move network cables, phone chargers, a scanner, a webcam, my headphone extension, two cables per monitor, wireless router cables, printer cords, power strips, two external hard drives, and even my trash can. I had to move pretty much everything. Oh, except my pen cup. It stayed.

# The results

After an hour of work I gained approximately 0 inches of space on the right side. _What?_ Maybe I did something wrong, but when I started using it I realized I had the same amount of space that I did before. But it looks nice! And it feels better. At least, that's what I tell myself.
