Using David Allen’s definition, a project is anything that requires more than one action to complete. This can range from building a new web application to replacing the refrigerator filter.

With this definition in mind, it’s easy to see how your list of projects can be long. And being a knowledge worker, I have thousands of files and hundreds of meeting notes and whiteboard pictures — all of which are digital. Here’s a scenario:

## Building a Deck

Last summer I built a deck off the back of our house. I like doing handyman projects and I was looking forward to the challenge. Since I didn’t know what I was doing, I did a lot of research on the design and how to build it.

I planned out the actions in [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) and clipped about a hundred pictures and how-to articles from the web into [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=49404&sig=e2dd914576c3ec9818e0311976a19dc1). I also had some files that I downloaded to reference during the build. I had a lot of information before I had even started — and this was only one project. I usually have about 50 going at once.

There were a number of times when I spent an embarrassing amount of time looking for a picture I had clipped.

Now multiply this by 50 projects. It can quickly become a mess. I spent a lot of time working on this problem, since I knew it wouldn’t go away. Eventually, I found a solution that I’m rather fond of.

## Where do you put it?

The first step is deciding what type of information goes where. For me, that means action items go into Omnifocus, files go into Dropbox with [my file nomenclature](http://joebuhlig.com/file-naming-disorganization/), and everything else goes into Evernote. I highly recommend using as few places as you can for information. It reduces the number of places you’ll have to look later on.

## Personal Project Codes

The next step is to find a way to quickly pull up the data for a project. I experimented with this for a while and eventually came up with the idea for personal project codes. We use them for business all the time. Why don’t I use them for me? Seems logical.

The idea is simple. Append a project code to the name of every project in Omnifocus, note in Evernote, and the filename for a file. Because it becomes part of the names in each of these, I tried to keep mine as short as possible.

For me, the codes look like this:

{% highlight text %}
14HC13
{% endhighlight %}

Decoded, the “14” is for the year 2014\. “HC” stands for House/Car. It’s a 2 character indicator for the area of responsibility in my life. I have 11, but a few of those are “WK” for work, “HU” for husband, “BL” for this blog, and “FR” for friend. The last two characters in the code is an auto-incrementing number. I use a [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) snippet to create my codes and it automatically increases this number by one every time I create a new one. I’m writing a post on this snippet to come out next week.

I create the code the first time in Evernote when I name the project. For the deck, the note was titled "14HC13: Build Deck” and contains any initial ideas, outcomes, or brainstorming. I do this for every new project. This is key because I can search Evernote for the code of the project I want. But in most cases, I’ve worked with the code long enough that I just know it.

## The Benefits

Because the code is in the name of the item, I can search for it and pull up just the information for that project. I can see all of the notes I’ve taken for a project or all the files I’ve collected. I’ve even been exploring [Path Finder](http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/) and trying to find ways to pull up Omnifocus, Evernote, and my files all in a single search.
