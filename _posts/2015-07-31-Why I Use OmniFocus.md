Task managers. There are so many options available and it’s painful making a decision, especially when it takes real dollars to get into them.

There’s a lot of hype around to-do list apps, but I’m not known for jumping into an app just because people are excited about it. And with task managers, I knew I was picky. I did the normal thing and ran Google searches to find out what the broader internet prefers. It was a mixed bag and that was three years ago. It’s worse now.

Not knowing whose opinion to trust, I pulled together my list of needs in a task manager. I compared that to the list of task managers I could find and quickly concluded that [OmniFocus](http://joebuhlig.com/tag/omnifocus/) was my only real option.

I recently tried this again to see if there were new options that met my criteria, but I came up short. It seems the [OmniGroup](https://www.omnigroup.com/) is the only team thinking detailed enough to fit my needs.

## [<span></span>](#design)Design

I’ve done enough UI/UX design and development to realize that the OmniFocus interface is pretty sophisticated. You can tell that every line and every pixel is in place for a reason. They’ve thought it through enough to get the interface out of the way and let you work. That’s tough to pull off.

If the design (what it looks like _and_ how you use it) of an application isn’t simple, appealing, and highly functioning, I delete it. I know that there are enough options out there that I’ll find what I’m looking for or I’ll build it myself.

## [<span></span>](#trust)Trust

I have to know that my data is safe. If I’m developing a web application, the action steps to complete it cannot disappear. And they cannot duplicate. I can’t worry about my task lists _and_ the task itself.

I’ve never had problems with one of OmniGroup’s products and I don’t hear of many (if any) data issues that aren’t user-induced. If they introduce a product or feature, it just works.

## [<span></span>](#defer-dates)Defer dates

This is a big sticking point that no other app handles correctly and a lot of OmniFocus users mention as a selling point. It’s like a snooze button for tasks. I need to be able to put tasks off until later. Let me give you a date and time of when I want to see that task again.

This is _not_ a due date. Using arbitrary due dates will get you in trouble every time.

Right now I’m recovering from surgery and have a 10 lb lifting restriction. That means I can’t work on most of my DIY projects. So I defer them to keep my lists from being cluttered.

OmniFocus is the only application I’ve found that handles this. And it does it beautifully.

## [<span></span>](#project-planning)Project planning

The ability to edit tasks by project and also by context seems simple. But I was amazed by the number of GTD-centric apps that don’t have this. It’s one of the foundations of the framework. I need a list of projects with the next action for each, and every action must have a context. Conclusion: I need to see tasks by project _and_ by context.

## [<span></span>](#applescript)AppleScript

I do a lot of customization and automation. And my task manager is not exempt. I need it to integrate with everything I do on my Mac. From automatically parsing tasks to adding tasks, it needs to fit in.

At the end of the day, I only have one choice. And it’s one that I’ve grown to really enjoy. OmniFocus is a killer task manager that looks nice and gets out of the way when I need to work.

P.S. You can find a lot more detail about OmniFocus in [my book](http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus/). But I’d like to finish writing it first.
