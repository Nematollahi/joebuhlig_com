I've received a number of requests for more detail around my use of [Workflow][WorkflowApp] ([iTunes][WorkflowITunes]). I've said that it saves time, but here are some details.

If I find myself doing something repeatedly, I look for a way to automate it. Since AppleScripting isn't possible on iOS, I turn to Workflow for some of the same functionality. Here are my heavy hitter workflows.

## Headed Home

[Headed Home Workflow][HeadedHomeWorkflow]

<img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Workflow_Headed-Home.png" />

There a quite a few instances each week when I'm out of the house without a specific time that I'm expected to return. My wife often needs to know when I'm headed home so she can plan accordingly. In those cases, I use this workflow to let her know I'm on my way and how long it should be before I get there. This workflow is one of three that I keep in the Today View for easy access because I use it so frequently.

## Copy Base URL

[Copy Base URL Workflow][CopyBaseURLWorkflow]

This is a rare case when I introduce more steps to a process in order to get a cleaner result. Many times I need to copy a URL but I really don't like having extra querystring parameters at the end of the URL. I use this to expand shortened URLS and strip the extra nonsense off the end. Then it's added to my clipboard.

## Save to DropBox

[Save to DropBox Workflow][SaveToDropBoxWorkflow]

Any time I run across a file (typically a PDF) on my phone that I want to save to DropBox, I use this. I could do the "Open in..." thing, but I know where I want it to go in DropBox before I even start - my DropBox inbox. This workflow takes the file and drops it into my inbox. It's faster than everything else I've tried.

## Share Title & Twitter

[Share Title & Twitter Workflow][ShareTitleTwitterWorkflow]

I have another [one similar to this][ShareWithTwitterArticle] that shares an article with a Twitter handle and asks for a comment about the article. If I don't have a specific thought about an article but still want to share it, I use this instead. It puts the title of the article in quotes, adds a link to the article, and searches the page for a Twitter handle to include at the end of the tweet.

## InstaTweet

[InstaTweet Workflow][InstaTweetWorkflow]

When I want to share a photo on Instagram and Twitter I know I can select Twitter from Instagram, but I prefer to embed them directly. This workflow allows me to select the photo, add a caption, and send it both places at once.

## Article to PDF

[Article to PDF Workflow][ArticleToPDFWorkflow]

This is a small piece of my research storage mechanism. To save an article  for a project I'm working on, I run this workflow which saves it as a PDF in my DropBox inbox. These are processed during my [Daily Review][DailyReviewArticle] and are often moved to project folders.

## Take Pic to DropBox

[Take Pic to DropBox Workflow][TakePicToDropBoxWorkflow]

This is similar to the Article to PDF workflow, but it opens the camera. I take a picture and it is immediately sent to my DropBox inbox. This is really handy if I want to save a picture of a restaurant menu or a bag of coffee. When I process these, I move them to their respective locations in my file structure for reference.

## Send Pic to DropBox

[Send Pic to DropBox Workflow][SendPicToDropBoxWorkflow]

Just like the previous workflow, this adds a picture to my DropBox inbox but allows me to select pictures from my photo library. There are times when I remember taking a picture that I want to use for a project. This helps me get them into DropBox quickly and easily. 

## Screenshot to DropBox

[Screenshot to DropBox Workflow][ScreenshotToDropBoxWorkflow]

I'm building a lot of websites lately and part of my process involves looking for web design inspiration. This means I'm taking a lot of screenshots of other websites. I keep this workflow in my Today View so I can take the screenshot, swipe down, and send it to DropBox right away.
