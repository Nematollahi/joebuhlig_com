A great asset behind OmniFocus is the community of people willing to share and ask questions; and one place to enjoy the resources this community creates is at [Learn OmniFocus](http://learnomnifocus.com/?ref=11).

Tim Stringer, founder of Learn OmniFocus, recently invited me to do a live webinar about my OmniFocus setup on the site and add to this growing repository of content. I was thrilled and  honored to share.

In the recording below you'll see normal stuff like setting up projects and contexts, but I also emphasize the importance of doing regular reviews and share a script I've written to help. I like doing reviews on set days, so I needed to be able to move the Next Review Date of a project to match my scheduled review date. If you're interested in this script or some of the others I mention in the webinar, you can [find them on GitHub](https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts). 

Outside of [Working with Omnifocus](https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/), this is one of the most complete overviews of my entire system. Tim Stringer has generously given me the feed to share with you, so check it out.
