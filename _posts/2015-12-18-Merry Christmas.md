I'm thrilled to give you a gift for Christmas this year. I've wanted to do something like this for a long time and the opportunity is finally here.

I enjoy helping others and I've heard from a lot of people that _Working with OmniFocus_ has finally showed them the tools they needed to put their life in perspective. Folks have shared stories about being able to start a business because of the principles shared in the book. One reader found treatment for a serious illness in their child because they were able to work clearly with the doctors. That blows my mind.

If you've been on the fence about buying the book, want to give yourself a Christmas present, or know someone who might benefit from reading it, here's a discount code for you to use when buying [_Working with OmniFocus_](https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/). Use the code `Christmas15` when filling in your information and it will take $5 off the price. The code will be valid through the day after Christmas.

And if you're willing, send me your story. I love hearing from you. Merry Christmas!
