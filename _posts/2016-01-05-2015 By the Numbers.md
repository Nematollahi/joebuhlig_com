With 2015 completed, we'll start seeing numbers roll in summarizing what happened throughout the year. So I thought I would pull together this site's numbers for 2015. It's been a ride.

## Top Articles

This is the most basic form of counting I do: how many views did each article receive? The OmniFocus Setup article has always been my top article, but one of the newcomers is the Monthly Planning article. It made the top 10 in views for the year and it's only been live for three weeks.

## Whaddya Know Joe?

One of my goals for 2015 was to step into the podcasting world, and I have been amazed by the number of you who have been listening. [_Whaddya Know Joe?_](http://joebuhlig.com/whaddyaknowjoe/) has only been public for about five months and it managed to break the 10,000 downloads mark right at the end of December.

Here are the top five episodes by download count:

## Working with OmniFocus

This is my favorite accomplishment of 2015. I had been wanting to write a book for a long time but never had the time. It seems that there were a lot of you interested in reading it as well. In two short months, there were 667 copies of [_Working with OmniFocus_](https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/) sold! I wasn't expecting anywhere near that number when I started, and I've been overwhelmed by the feedback. Thank you.

## H&A Tech

In August, I left the company I was working for and started my own business. It was a fast and unnerving transition, but I'm thrilled to be where I am today. I'm able to work on the projects I love and build things with little or no delay. If I get a crazy idea, I can pursue it without worrying about politics or the red tape of company approvals. I wish I could have done this sooner.
