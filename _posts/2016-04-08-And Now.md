I ran across this idea when reading an article by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/). The premise is simple: creating a frequently updated page to show what the person is currently doing. The concept really resonated with me, and I expanded on it a bit.

Sivers calls it a _Now_ page and even created [an index of these pages](http://nownownow.com/). I started looking through these pages and loved a lot of the ideas I found. It was a classic case of being unable to make up my mind. So instead of picking one area or one page to keep updated, I built a site that showcases where my time goes, what I'm reading, what I'm currently developing, and a growing portfolio of my work.

In the future, I'd like to add an Apps page that keeps a list of the tools I'm using on my devices, but that's an extensive addition, so it needs to come at a later time.

So if you're curious about what I'm up to, go check out [now.joebuhlig.com](http://now.joebuhlig.com).
