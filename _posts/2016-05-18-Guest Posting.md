Over the past month I've made some design changes and layout alterations here on the site. Some of that was purely for aesthetics and ease of use, but it also included some back-end alterations to allow guest posting. I've debated this for a long time and I'm finally ready to pull the trigger.

One of the best ways to expand our thinking is to explore new ideas and perspectives that may differ from our own. It forces us to formulate our own opinions on the subject. We may love the thought or think it's trash but either way, making that decision helps us understand our own reasoning behind the subject. By allowing others to write articles for this site, we can see glimpses of how others operate and think, which broadens the perspective on productivity conveyed here.

This also frees up some of my own time. I really like the current posting cadence, but I'm looking to direct some of my writing time to new areas. I have a couple important projects I'm working on that I want to dedicate more time to and I know there will be more projects when those are complete. Guest posting will allow the rhythm to continue and these new areas to accelerate.

I can continue listing reasons why I think this is a good thing, but you get the point. There's a lot of value that can come to all of us.
