There are times when you realize a project needs to take a hard turn. Your original intent is good, but it doesn't accomplish your goal as well as it might.

I find these moments bittersweet. They often result in something much better, but they also bring with them an extensive amount of rework. This was precisely my experience when I took on my second book, _Working With Ideas_.

I was working on the outline and collecting segments of content when I realized the medium for this content and its delivery system was wrong. It needed to reveal more emotion and story with more camaraderie than an e-book can provide. So I changed direction and turned it into a full video course with a community of idea workers to share the experience with.

I consider this my best work and I'm thrilled to share it with you. I'm so excited about it that I decided to make it possible to [get the course for free](http://pre.workingwithideas.co)! To get started, you simply need to [sign-up for the launch email](http://pre.workingwithideas.co) (which gets you $12 off by itself).
