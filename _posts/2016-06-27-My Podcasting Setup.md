I have detailed [my writing process](http://joebuhlig.com/the-science-and-experience-of-analog-writing/) quite a bit lately, but that made me realize I have never pulled all the pieces of my podcasting setup together. Let's change that.

## Equipment

I did a lot of research on beginners microphones before I started podcasting and although there are better ones out there, I landed on the [Rode Podcaster](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20). I have a dream of upgrading to a [Beta 87](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Supercardioid-Condenser-Microphone-Applications/dp/B0002BACBO/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20) at some point, but this does a great job for now. Altogether here's what I'm using:

- [Rode Podcaster](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20)
- [Rode Boom Stand](https://www.amazon.com/RODE-Swivel-Mount-Studio-Microphone/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20)
- [Rode Shockmount](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-PSM-1-Shockmount-Podcaster/dp/B000WA8KYG/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20)
- [Rode Popfilter](https://www.amazon.com/SM6-Shock-Mount-Integrated-Shield/dp/B004DE1K5S/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20)
- [V-MODA Crossfade Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-Crossfade-Over-Ear-Noise-Isolating-Headphone/dp/B003BYRGLI/ref=sr_1_8?tag=joebuhlig-20)

## Software

I have been a subscriber to the [Adobe Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) for a while now and really enjoy the power of their tools. They aren't for everyone, but if you have access to it [Audition CC](http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) does a great job of editing and recording. When I'm recording with someone else, I use the traditional set of software that most podcasters use:

- [Adobe Audition CC](http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)
- [MuteMyMic](http://mutemymic.com/)
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)
- [Skype Call Recorder](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/)

## Hosting

In my opinion, the gold standard for hosting your files is [Libsyn](https://www.libsyn.com/). It just works and I've never had an issue with them. My feed is a custom XML file generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). If you are a Jekyll user and want to run a podcast, you can get the [source code for this here](https://github.com/joebuhlig/Jekyll-Podcast-Feed).
