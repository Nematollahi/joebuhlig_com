Our ability to come up with ideas is like a muscle. If we work on it and develop the right habits, we get stronger and have more options available to us. But it's difficult to build muscle if you don't understand "how" the muscle works and the mechanics behind its improvement.

That's what [_Working With Ideas_](https://workingwithideas.co/) is all about: how do you create an idea and what do you do once you have it?  And I'm excited to say [_Working With Ideas is now open_](https://workingwithideas.co/)!

For two weeks, the course will be $25 off its regular price, so get in early to take advantage of the launch price. You can learn more and get a free sample by [going to the course homepage](https://workingwithideas.co/).
