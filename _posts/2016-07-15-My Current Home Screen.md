The biggest time wasters on my phone and the ones I have consolidated are social media, RSS feeds, and email. Once those were all funneled into email, they didn't need to be on my phone at all. That meant Feedly, Google+, Pinterest, and LinkedIn all disappeared.

The big one here was Feedly. I normally used it as a triage tool, sending articles I wanted to read to Pocket. But I've always disliked their need to auto-shorten links when I share an article. It was bad enough that I built [Workflow actions to overcome it](http://joebuhlig.com/workflow-to-share-articles-with-twitter-handle/). The main reason I originally used Pocket was the IFTTT integration. This inbox consolidation process made me comb through my recipes and realize I wasn't using IFTTT with Pocket anymore. I had slowly turned off all the connections with it. Goodbye, Pocket. Hello, [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com). I've wanted to switch for a while anyway.
