Working With OmniFocus has been recreated in video format!  It's now available on the new dedicated website: [workingwithomnifocus.com](https://workingwithomnifocus.com).

Something I didn't plan on with this project was the expansion of content. By the time I finished the set of videos, I realized there are over four hours of content and an additional 40% in topics covered over the book. And I already have another hour worth of topics in the queue. So it's easy to say that this is a pretty extensive resource and I'm really excited to share it with you!

Quick note: if you've previously purchased the book, check your email. There's a present waiting for you there. If you haven't bought the book, you can still get it as part of the video series. I'm keeping it simple and throwing it all into one package.

Go check out [the new website](https://workingwithomnifocus.com)! There are a handful of freebies there even if you're not planning to buy.
