One of my most hated tasks is setting the price for a new product. It's painful and it seems like I can never get it right. The bright side is that I've been able to learn a lot in the process and that has led me to a price simplification, effective immediately.

Let's start with the popular one, [_Working With OmniFocus_](https://workingwithomnifocus.com). When I originally released it as a book, it was $17 at launch and moved to $22 dollars a week later. This worked well from a financial standpoint but it led to a number of emails from folks who missed the early discount. I have no issues with people asking about it, but it took time I wasn't expecting to give. And from a long term business stance, it also means that potential buyers may hold off on making a purchase thinking the price may come down again in the future. As opposed to playing these discount games, I'd rather it be set and consistent.

When _Working With OmniFocus_ moved to a video course it seemed logical to me (and friends in the business) that raising the price to $37 was easily justified if not a little low. That may be true if I'm trying to make it a more exclusive membership, but I'm not. I would rather it be in the hands of more people and have a broader impact. Following basic supply and demand principles, that means the current price needs to be reconsidered.

[_Working With Ideas_](https://workingwithideas.co) was plagued with many of the same issues. It was a lot more intensive to develop and after consulting others who have done something similar, I landed on $72. Again, this creates the feeling of exclusivity that I'm _not_ shooting for. Especially considering I've left it at the introductory price due to a lack of interest.

And then there's Working With Alfred. This one is extremely new on the horizon and has a long way to go yet. But the pricing discussion for this one is the same. Where should it land and how can I price it to be accessible to a large number of users while covering my costs?

One thing I've learned in my pricing adventure is that I love simplicity and consistency. I also place value in reaching higher numbers of people with the resources I create. So that means I want to bring everything to a uniform price, preferably at the lower end of my comfort zone. Based on my experience and trusting my intuition, that leads me to $17 for each.

So effective today, _Working With OmniFocus_ and _Working With Ideas_ are each __$17__. And I'm no longer doing discounts or release pricing. It's also means that when Working With Alfred is released it'll be $17 as well. I'm keeping it simple and dependable.
