As you can tell by my co-hosting of three different shows, I have embraced my love for podcasting. But, apparently, running three shows of my own isn't enough.

Jay and I talk about a wide variety of topics involving my development work, how he should get into development, the work I'm kicking off on [Productivity Guild](https://productivityguild.com), digital vs. analog task management, and a number of tangents around productivity in general. It's a good time. You should [check it out](https://productivityintech.com/pitpodcast/64).
