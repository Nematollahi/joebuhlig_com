This was a really fun show I did with Matt Ward and Dan Candell over on the [Square Peg Round Hole Podcast](http://sprhpodcast.com/ep-43-building-communities-that-help-your-small-business-thrive/). We get to talk about building online communities (in my case [Productivity Guild](https://productivityguild.com)) and how those compare to FaceBook communities. Ultimately, treat your community like a close friend.
