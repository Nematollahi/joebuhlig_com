		<p>I’ve been struggling with goal-setting lately, enough that I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/from-goals-to-guides/">abandoned my annual goals altogether</a>. But I’ve found that I want something to help guide the systems that I’m putting in place.
<!--more--></p>

<h1 id="traditional-goal-setting">Traditional goal-setting</h1>

<p>In the past, I’ve set personal and professional goals annually using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> method. It gave me a sense of pride. I knew I was on a path to do some big things. And that was great motivation at the onset of the year.</p>

<p>But after a month, (sometimes two), I forgot about my goals and drift from thing to thing. The shiny new object motivation was gone. And more often than not, there would be a change in the circumstances or assumptions that my goals were based on. If I could, I would re-factor them and start again.</p>

<p>By the end of the year, my goals looked nothing like the originals. And in most cases, I failed to hit them. Year after year of the same process finally frustrated me enough to stop and think about the foundation of goal-setting.</p>

<h1 id="the-alternative">The alternative</h1>

<p>I reflected on my inability to complete goals and looked for patterns. It turned out that every three months I was trying to re-imagine my goals for the year. I was setting goals quarterly, but didn’t consider altering their deadlines to reflect the changes. If I’m naturally setting goals quarterly, why not embrace it?</p>

<p>I’m just starting this journey, but here’s why I think this could work:</p>

<h2 id="not-too-long">1. Not too long</h2>

<p>Life happens too fast for annual goals. Circumstances and mindsets can change quickly and a year is too long. I found myself waiting for the year to end so that I could start something new. Why wait if I’ve abandoned or completed my original goal?</p>

<p>Moving to a shorter time period allows me to accept my three month cycle.</p>

<h2 id="shiny-new-object-motivation">2. Shiny new object motivation</h2>

<p>I can take advantage of my excitement at the onset. I’m usually pretty stoked to get started on new goals. If I’m planning more frequently, I can use the early motivation to accomplish things faster and gain focus.</p>

<h2 id="success-cycle">3. Success cycle</h2>

<p>I’m lacking the drive that comes from successfully reaching a goal. When I achieve a goal, I get excited and want to do more. By using shorter periods, I have more opportunities for success and can create a cycle of winning.</p>

<h1 id="my-plan">My plan</h1>

<p>I’m just coming to this idea and haven’t tested it… at all. It’s a journey that I’ll do my best to share. My plan for the next week is to set goals for the next 3 months, share as many of them as I can with you, and let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>That’s the goal anyway.</p>
