		<p>I’m terrible at estimating time. I always think that I can complete more than I truly can. I throw 8 things on a list for the day and go. I can complete them all… or not. If I’m honest with myself, I know that I can’t do it all.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I used to wake up in the morning and do my normal morning ritual. Part of that routine was to go through my to-do lists and choose tasks for that day. It was a good feeling to know I had prepared a list of actions for the day - my Today List.</p>

<h2 id="my-struggle">My Struggle</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, when I would start to wrap things up, I would realize I still had items on my list. Not a big deal. I’d just move them to tomorrow’s list.</p>

<p>But it would happen again. And again. And again. Once in a while I would finish it but most of the time the cycle repeated. It didn’t matter if I had a productive day or not. As long as I had items on that list at the end, it felt like I had lost. I didn’t do enough. I failed.</p>

<p>I tried to find productivity tricks to help me accomplish more during the day, but it never worked. The cycle continued.</p>

<h2 id="mits">3 MITs</h2>

<p>Thankfully, I ran across an article by Leo Babauta of <a href="http://www.zenhabits.net">Zen Habits</a>. It was about <a href="http://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/">picking your 3 MITs</a> or Most Important Tasks for the day. It’s a simple concept. Choose 3 things that you want to complete that day and focus on those. If you do nothing else all day, you still completed the most important things you needed to do.</p>

<p>I was a bit hesitant at first. I had more than 3 things I needed to do each day. But when I started to look at my list, I realized I had a lot of <em>wants</em> along with <em>needs</em> on it. I decided to try it and saw results on day one. I quickly finished my 3 MITs and realized that I had a productive day behind me and it was only 10am. It was energizing.</p>

<h2 id="the-head-game">The Head Game</h2>

<p>I learned that it was a head game. It’s the difference between achieving your goal and failing to hit it. If you set a realistic goal and hit it, you’re motivated to keep moving. If you set an optimistic goal and miss it, you’re disheartened and want to quit.</p>

<p>I’m not perfect with the process. I still find that I want to pick 4 or 5 items for the day, but if I stop long enough to think about each one I can usually find one or two that are <em>nice-to-haves</em> and pull them.</p>

<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>

<p>There seems to be this awesome side-effect of accomplishing more each day. When I know that I’ve already had a productive day by 10am, it makes me want to keep going and knock a lot of things out.</p>
