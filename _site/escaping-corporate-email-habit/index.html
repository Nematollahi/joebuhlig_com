		<p>I used to pride myself in having one of the fastest email replies in the office. If you sent me an email, I was back to you in less than 10 minutes. Sometimes 5.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Like most corporations, we used Outlook for email and calendaring. I had it set up to alert me every time I got a new email. On average, I was receiving around 100 emails a day. That’s a lot of dings. In the office environment, email was as good as IM.</p>

<p>It’s interesting what 100 dings in a day will do to your focus. Every time I got into the groove of something I heard that ding and my Pavlovian instinct kicked in. I read and responded to the email and went back to work. That’s fine, but I then spent a few minutes trying to get back into the groove I had just lost. It wasn’t working. The more email I sent, the more I received and my projects were suffering because of it.</p>

<h2 id="turning-off-email">Turning off email?</h2>

<p>I had read and listened to a lot of folks that <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2008/8/21/mail-notification-liberation.html">turned off email notifications</a> and checked email <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/breaking-e-mail-addiction.html">only a few times</a> during the day. It seemed ridiculous to me. <em>Why would I make people wait to hear back from me? What if something urgent comes up? What if my boss needs something?</em> It didn’t make sense to me.</p>

<p>But these people seemed to like it. And if it worked for them all the time I figured I could try it for a day. If it worked, great! If not, oh well. I’d look for a different solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>

<p>I scheduled 9 times to process my email that day. I didn’t want to go crazy and only open Outlook once all day. That was too much. So I chose to check it once an hour during the work day. I would spend as long as I needed at the top of every hour to bring my inbox down to empty — I was already maintaining inbox zero.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-day">The first day</h2>

<p>The first email check was fine. It was at the beginning of the day and I had to get caught up from the late night emails (crazy night owls). But then I had to shut Outlook down. That was hard. I don’t think I had done that for anything other than restarting my computer since I started with the company almost 2 years before. But I managed to do it.</p>

<p>I was sitting on a porcupine that hour. I kept wondering if I had something in my email that I needed to respond to. I was pretty much useless. Zero work accomplished, sir. I was watching the clock - just waiting for the chance to open Outlook. At the top of the hour, I promptly started rifling through emails.</p>

<p>What struck me was the lack of urgency in them. There wasn’t anything that needed a response right away. <em>That’s odd</em>. So I closed it down again and went back to work. I was still thinking about it, but it wasn’t as pressing this time.</p>

<p>The next email check came and although there was a couple of things that were urgent, they didn’t <em>need</em> an immediate response. They could wait a few hours, but only waited about 30 minutes. This process continued throughout the day.</p>

<p>At the end, I realized that I had accomplished a lot of my actual work and had managed to keep up with email. No buildings burned down. My boss didn’t throw a fit. And I felt pretty good about the day. It had been one of my most productive days in a long time.</p>

<h2 id="since-leaving-corporate">Since leaving corporate</h2>

<p>I’ve since left the corporate office scene and work from home full time. I now check my email twice a day. If something is important enough that someone needs a response quicker than 5 hours, they call me. If they’re going to call me, why would I spend my time monitoring my inbox? I’ve got better things to do.</p>
