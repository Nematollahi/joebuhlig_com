        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/embracing-the-new-textexpander.jpg" /><p>When <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/">Smile</a> introduced the new “Snippet As A Service” version of TextExpander, there was quite an outcry. To be completely honest, I was confused by and resistant to the change at the onset. However, if I look at the new version without allowing my previous experience to color my opinion, it is striking how similar it is to my other choices for software.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<p>One of the big complaints is the location used for data storage and syncing. Previously, we used DropBox or some other syncing service to host and update our snippets as we alter them. The new version forces you to use <a href="//smile.7eer.net/c/298450/277331/2936">textexpander.com</a> as the backend. I understand the concern over data control here but it really doesn’t apply to me. I already use the backend for other software and services like OmniFocus, Workflow, and Overcast. This isn’t much different.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>This is the one that got me at first. Year-over-year, the price to me would increase almost twofold. At least, that’s what it was originally. Since release, Smile listened to the flood of feedback and generously implemented a 50% upgrade discount for life. In the end, that means I’m paying no more than I have in the past. It’s a wash.</p>

<h2 id="subscription">Subscription</h2>

<p>Anymore I’m slow to upgrade hardware. But software is a different story. I deliberately limit the number of tools I use, which means I pick quality, pro-user tools with a lot of features and flexibility. Any time these tools have an upgrade available, I like to jump on it quickly. If you look at it from a high-level, I am effectively paying a subscription plan already. By adopting this recurring payment structure, I get no-hassle updates without the worry.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<p>My big question when I first saw the release of the new TextExpander was about features. What’s new that would lead me to upgrade? I didn’t have an answer. But then I tried the trial and found two features that are important to me and a third I’m considering.</p>

<p>The first is inline search. You type a keyword anywhere, hit a keyboard shortcut (that you can customize), and see search results of your matching snippets. Since we typically have these memorized it may not sound very useful until you consider the pain of changing your snippet abbreviations or a database with hundreds of snippets. I find the need to alter abbreviations every few months which means the inline search ability has received a lot of my attention.</p>

<p>Second, the <a href="//smile.7eer.net/c/298450/277331/2936">website</a>. It seems unnecessary at first. If you have the apps, why would you use the website? Then I ran into a couple instances where I wanted a block of text from TextExpander while on a different profile on my computer. I don’t want TextExpander on it for other reasons but it’s incredibly handy to log on to the website to access that data. It makes it possible to retrieve the info I want without a software installation.</p>

<p>And the feature I’m considering is the one that initiated this whole thing: teams and sharing. I can see a lot of value in sharing email templates with clients or for <a href="http://bookworm.fm">Bookworm</a>. Anytime there are communications, blocks of text, or forms that are used by multiple people, this could save us all a lot of time. I haven’t tried it yet, but I’m looking for the opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="personal-use-only">Personal Use Only?</h2>

<p>With all of this in mind, I’m happy with my choice to upgrade to the new TextExpander even if I choose not to use the sharing features. There’s enough added value in the new version and consistency in pricing (for me) to convince me to buy in. TextExpander is one of those core applications I incorporate into a lot of other tools. That means I want it up-to-date. And since there are new possibilities that come along for the ride, I’m exploring the options that the new functionality gives me.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/leaving-pocket-for-instapaper.jpeg" /><p>I follow specific websites less and less. I’m more inclined to follow people and services on Twitter and <a href="https://medium.com/@JoeBuhlig">Medium</a> that act as sources of curated articles. This gives me the ability to find sites I normally would have glossed over and still read my favorite writers.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But regardless of where I find these articles, I still need a way to save them for later. I rarely have time to read an article the moment I discover it. In the past I’ve used Pocket, but I have now moved to <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>.</p>

<p>Originally, I chose Pocket for its IFTTT integration. I had built a number of recipes that acted on the tagging ability of Pocket. But over time I slowly turned these off one by one, mostly due to my move away from tagging articles.</p>

<p>I still would’ve stayed with Pocket if they had simply left the URLs of the articles alone. When I’m finished with an article, I either archive it or share it. But if you share it through Pocket, they insist on shortening the URL with their custom link. The only way around it that I have found is to have <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow</a> expand the the link before sharing. When I see links shared by others, I use the top level domain (TLD) of the link as part of my decision about whether or not I want to read it. So I don’t want my own links preventing that ability.</p>

<p>Coupled with the link shortening is the difficulty in sharing quotes from Pocket. It is similarly complicated to do so without the Pocket custom link. Contrast this with Instapaper, where it works perfectly without the need for Workflow actions to expand the link and format the text. Instapaper uses the link you originally saved and gets out of the way.</p>

<p>The reading experience is also far better on Instapaper. They give a lot of options to customize the reading view. And since these are apps designed for reading, I feel this is paramount. The experience in Pocket is not bad, I simply prefer the environment created and allowed by Instapaper.</p>

<p>When I realized I was no longer using IFTTT with Pocket it gave me the freedom to explore other options. And because I have been watching Instapaper for a long time hoping their IFTTT integration would progress, it was the perfect time to switch. I no longer needed Instapaper to adopt a deeper relationship with IFTTT, so I could make the transition with zero compromises.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/base/WorkingWithOmniFocus-Small.png" /><p>It’s been about nine months since I released <em>Working With OmniFocus</em>. A lot has happened in that time and my systems around OmniFocus have morphed quite a bit. Throw in a pile of learning accrued from other projects and I have decided to make some significant changes to the book.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="video">Video</h2>

<p>Easily the most prominent change will be the medium through which the content is delivered. Words on page work well, but when software is involved video can be a better route to follow. The ability to visually demonstrate a concept and how it works can dramatically increased the comprehension level of the viewer. So in the near future <em>Working With OmniFocus</em> will no longer be a book, but a repository of over 60 screencasts explaining and visualizing the idea at hand.</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>I originally built a custom Ruby and Rails application to host the sales page and associated mechanisms for the book. That works well but gets to be a lot of maintenance that I’d rather not have. So <em>Working With OmniFocus</em> is moving to a new home on the web: <a href="https://workingwithomnifocus.com">workingwithomnifocus.com</a>. Obviously, this is currently under development and will continue to change over the next few weeks.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic">Dynamic</h2>

<p>One of the major difficulties in writing a book about software is the static nature of a book compared to the continual development of the software. It makes it difficult to keep the book up to date. By moving to web-based video and breaking the content into smaller pieces, it allows me to tweak the content as the program changes.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>I hate pricing. Throw in discounts, launch promotions, and levels of access and it’s a nightmare to me. I have avoided much of this by sticking with a single price and I’m not leaving that mindset. In this case, the content will be more advanced and have more depth so I know the price will need to increase over the price of the book. I don’t currently have an answer on what it will cost, but I do know that those who have purchased the book (and those who <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">purchase it before the relaunch</a>) will receive $20 off the videos.</p>

<h2 id="affiliates">Affiliates</h2>

<p>The current affiliate program for the book has been a big success for me and I plan to continue to run one for the videos. But since I’m rebuilding the site, the mechanism will be different and will require you to sign up again for the new program. I know this is inconvenient but it will be better for all of us in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="book">Book?</h2>

<p>I’m not planning to update the book itself and the ability to purchase it by itself will go away. I will, however, make it available to those who purchase the video series with the caveat that my processes mentioned in the book are out of date.</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>I’m really excited about these changes.  I will be able to explain the mindsets and demonstrate the app mechanisms in much more detail than was ever possible through the book. I’m devoting most of my current working time to these edits and plan to deliver it in mid to late August.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/textexpander-and-omnifocus.jpeg" /><p>TextExpander and OmniFocus are <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/first-apps-on-a-new-mac/">two of the first tools</a> I install on any new device, so it’s no surprise that the two work well together. You may expect some kind of Applescripting or shell magic, but I keep this extremely simple and only use true text expansion with OmniFocus. I run the scripts manually or behind the scenes with Hazel.
<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>xwait = “Waiting for “</strong></p>

<p>This is easily the most commonly used snippet I have for OmniFocus. Any time I need to create a new Waiting For task, I always type <em>xwait</em> and keep going. It’s not a huge savings in one instance but multiply this by the average 20 uses a day and it really adds up.</p>

<p><strong>xresp = “Waiting for response from “</strong></p>

<p>Similar to the first, I use this one a lot. I receive and send a ton of email. Any time I send one that warrants a response, a new task is created and this is where the naming starts.</p>

<p><strong>xplan = “Plan project for “</strong></p>

<p>Most of the time when I decide to take on a new project, I don’t have time right then to plan it out. So I use this to create a task for the planning process.</p>

<p><strong>xpfm = “Plan for meeting re: “</strong></p>

<p>I don’t use this as much as I used to, but this helps me create a new task as a reminder to review meeting materials and get resources together for a call.</p>

<p><strong>xlook = “Look into “</strong></p>

<p>I do a ton of research to help me get better at a project or learn how a new process works. I always start these tasks with “Look into” as an indicator to Google, read, or learn about the item.</p>

<p><strong>xdwc = “ (Delete when complete)”</strong></p>

<p>I stole this one from <a href="http://www.usingomnifocus.com">Kourosh</a>. I sometimes have repeating tasks that are creative in some form or don’t have a clear definition of “completed.” I augment the end of the task title with “(Delete when complete)” so I know to delete the task instead of check it off when I’m done with it. That will keep it from repeating when it’s done and allow the project to move on.</p>

<p><strong>x5tom = “5am tomorrow”</strong></p>

<p>Occasionally, I need to push a task off until tomorrow. When I do, I use this in the Defer Date field to push it out one day. I could hit the “+1 day” button but this is habit.</p>

<p>Overall, this is extremely basic compared to what is possible. But this does all I need,  there’s no point overcomplicating it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/my-current-home-screen.png" /><p>When I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-overwhelm-inbox/">consolidated a handful of my inboxes</a> into my email it made me rethink my home screen. I had previously kept it slim but this takes it a step further and creates significant resistance to activities better left undone.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The biggest time wasters on my phone and the ones I have consolidated are social media, RSS feeds, and email. Once those were all funneled into email, they didn’t need to be on my phone at all. That meant Feedly, Google+, Pinterest, and LinkedIn all disappeared.</p>

<p>The big one here was Feedly. I normally used it as a triage tool, sending articles I wanted to read to Pocket. But I’ve always disliked their need to auto-shorten links when I share an article. It was bad enough that I built <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/workflow-to-share-articles-with-twitter-handle/">Workflow actions to overcome it</a>. The main reason I originally used Pocket was the IFTTT integration. This inbox consolidation process made me comb through my recipes and realize I wasn’t using IFTTT with Pocket anymore. I had slowly turned off all the connections with it. Goodbye, Pocket. Hello, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>. I’ve wanted to switch for a while anyway.</p>

<p>Once I deleted a few apps, I started thinking through how I use my phone. If the app isn’t on the front screen, I swipe down and search for it. If I’m going to launch apps with Spotlight, why keep multiple folders of them? I combined them into a single folder in order to bury the apps that are most tempting, but still keep them around for their Share Sheet functions. These are primarily Twitter and Instagram.</p>

<p>I’ve been using my phone this way for about a month now and it has seriously helped me limit my phone usage. It’s geared toward getting work done as opposed to blowing time. If I’m going to blow time, I’m <a href="http://bookworm.fm">better off reading</a>.</p>

If we work on it and develop the right habits, we get stronger and have more options available to us. But it’s difficult to build muscle if you don’t understand “how” the muscle works and the mechanics behind its improvement. Getting ideas is challenging until you learn what they are and how they work.

Very few of them explain the scenarios necessary to make their conclusion valid.

<p>We all operate differently, and we all have different skill sets and ways of thinking about the tools we use. We have varying needs and that means there is no absolute on the best tool for a task. This is why I always say, “I don’t know” when asked what task manager you should use. I have no clue what your circumstances are and what you need from a list manager.</p>

<p>This is precisely why many people (myself included) recommend using tools you already know when taking on a habit or system. It eliminates the need to learn a new tool and a new structure at the same time. But it’s more than that. The new structure will push you to develop a new mindset. Over time, you will begin to think about the items within your process in a more nuanced way as your ideas and rationale behind it progress.</p>

<p>Tools can get in the way of developing this nuanced thinking. You may start searching for an app to solve procrastination when you actually need to name your tasks differently. You need to understand yourself, how you operate, and what you need before deciding a new tool is the solution. And you can only take on a new tool successfully when you know what it offers that will suit your mindset. <em>That’s</em> when the articles comparing software are helpful.</p>

<p>It is only when you can sit down and spell out how a new tool will help that you understand your mindset well enough to warrant a potential change.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/bookwormlogo.png" /><p>Almost 2 months ago I embarked on a journey of reading a book every two weeks. Although there are a lot of personal benefits to doing this, it is primarily for a new podcast I’m doing with my good friend, <a href="http://mikeschmitz.me/">Mike Schmitz</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Mike and I have done a couple shows together in the past (<a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/057-joe-buhlig/">The Productivity Show</a> and <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/33/">Whaddya Know Joe</a>) and we each independently came to the conclusion that we wanted start a new show together. After a single call, Bookworm was born and recording commenced.</p>

<p>Bookworm is all about taking action on the words we read. Mike and I read a book, then talk about what it means for our lives. We can read all the books in the world but it’s for naught if we don’t do something with that knowledge.</p>

<p>Today we are revealing our work to the world. You can check it out it at <a href="http://bookworm.fm/">bookworm.fm</a> and find it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bookworm/id1132102092">on iTunes here</a>. We also have a Twitter handle for the show, <a href="https://twitter.com/bookwormfm">@bookwormfm</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a reader (or you’re not and want a summary), <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bookworm/id1132102092">subscribe now</a>. We’re super pumped about it and excited to talk books with you!</p>

Let’s change that.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>I did a lot of research on beginners microphones before I started podcasting and although there are better ones out there, I landed on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Podcaster</a>. I have a dream of upgrading to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Supercardioid-Condenser-Microphone-Applications/dp/B0002BACBO/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Beta 87</a> at some point, but this does a great job for now. Altogether here’s what I’m using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Podcaster</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/RODE-Swivel-Mount-Studio-Microphone/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Boom Stand</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-PSM-1-Shockmount-Podcaster/dp/B000WA8KYG/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Shockmount</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SM6-Shock-Mount-Integrated-Shield/dp/B004DE1K5S/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Popfilter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-Crossfade-Over-Ear-Noise-Isolating-Headphone/dp/B003BYRGLI/ref=sr_1_8?tag=joebuhlig-20">V-MODA Crossfade Headphones</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/my-podcasting-setup/rode-podcaster.jpeg" /></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I have been a subscriber to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> for a while now and really enjoy the power of their tools. They aren’t for everyone, but if you have access to it <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html">Audition CC</a> does a great job of editing and recording. When I’m recording with someone else, I use the traditional set of software that most podcasters use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html">Adobe Audition CC</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://mutemymic.com/">MuteMyMic</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/">Skype Call Recorder</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>In my opinion, the gold standard for hosting your files is <a href="https://www.libsyn.com/">Libsyn</a>. It just works and I’ve never had an issue with them. My feed is a custom XML file generated with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. If you are a Jekyll user and want to run a podcast, you can get the <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/Jekyll-Podcast-Feed">source code for this here</a>.</p>
