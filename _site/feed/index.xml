        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/introducing-working-with-ideas.jpeg" /><p>Our ability to come up with ideas is like a muscle. If we work on it and develop the right habits, we get stronger and have more options available to us. But it’s difficult to build muscle if you don’t understand “how” the muscle works and the mechanics behind its improvement. Getting ideas is challenging until you learn what they are and how they work.

<p>That’s what <a href="https://workingwithideas.co/"><em>Working With Ideas</em></a> is all about: how do you create an idea and what do you do once you have it?  And I’m excited to say <a href="https://workingwithideas.co/"><em>Working With Ideas is now open</em></a>!</p>

<p>For two weeks, the course will be $25 off its regular price, so get in early to take advantage of the launch price. You can learn more and get a free sample by <a href="https://workingwithideas.co/">going to the course homepage</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/mindsets-before-tools.jpeg" /><p>Every time I come across an article that compares applications or declares an app to be the best at something, I cringe. Very few of them explain the scenarios necessary to make their conclusion valid.
<!--more--></p>

<p>We all operate differently, and we all have different skill sets and ways of thinking about the tools we use. We have varying needs and that means there is no absolute on the best tool for a task. This is why I always say, “I don’t know” when asked what task manager you should use. I have no clue what your circumstances are and what you need from a list manager.</p>

<p>This is precisely why many people (myself included) recommend using tools you already know when taking on a habit or system. It eliminates the need to learn a new tool and a new structure at the same time. But it’s more than that. The new structure will push you to develop a new mindset. Over time, you will begin to think about the items within your process in a more nuanced way as your ideas and rationale behind it progress.</p>

<p>Tools can get in the way of developing this nuanced thinking. You may start searching for an app to solve procrastination when you actually need to name your tasks differently. You need to understand yourself, how you operate, and what you need before deciding a new tool is the solution. And you can only take on a new tool successfully when you know what it offers that will suit your mindset. <em>That’s</em> when the articles comparing software are helpful.</p>

<p>It is only when you can sit down and spell out how a new tool will help that you understand your mindset well enough to warrant a potential change.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/bookwormlogo.png" /><p>Almost 2 months ago I embarked on a journey of reading a book every two weeks. Although there are a lot of personal benefits to doing this, it is primarily for a new podcast I’m doing with my good friend, <a href="http://mikeschmitz.me/">Mike Schmitz</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Mike and I have done a couple shows together in the past (<a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/057-joe-buhlig/">The Productivity Show</a> and <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/33/">Whaddya Know Joe</a>) and we each independently came to the conclusion that we wanted start a new show together. After a single call, Bookworm was born and recording commenced.</p>

<p>Bookworm is all about taking action on the words we read. Mike and I read a book, then talk about what it means for our lives. We can read all the books in the world but it’s for naught if we don’t do something with that knowledge.</p>

<p>Today we are revealing our work to the world. You can check it out it at <a href="http://bookworm.fm/">bookworm.fm</a> and find it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bookworm/id1132102092">on iTunes here</a>. We also have a Twitter handle for the show, <a href="https://twitter.com/bookwormfm">@bookwormfm</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a reader (or you’re not and want a summary), <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bookworm/id1132102092">subscribe now</a>. We’re super pumped about it and excited to talk books with you!</p>

Let’s change that.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>I did a lot of research on beginners microphones before I started podcasting and although there are better ones out there, I landed on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Podcaster</a>. I have a dream of upgrading to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Supercardioid-Condenser-Microphone-Applications/dp/B0002BACBO/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Beta 87</a> at some point, but this does a great job for now. Altogether here’s what I’m using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Podcaster</a></li>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I have been a subscriber to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> for a while now and really enjoy the power of their tools. They aren’t for everyone, but if you have access to it <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html">Audition CC</a> does a great job of editing and recording. When I’m recording with someone else, I use the traditional set of software that most podcasters use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html">Adobe Audition CC</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://mutemymic.com/">MuteMyMic</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/">Skype Call Recorder</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>In my opinion, the gold standard for hosting your files is <a href="https://www.libsyn.com/">Libsyn</a>. It just works and I’ve never had an issue with them. My feed is a custom XML file generated with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. If you are a Jekyll user and want to run a podcast, you can get the <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/Jekyll-Podcast-Feed">source code for this here</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/time-for-books.jpeg" /><p>In order to read a book every two weeks (and sometimes every week) I have had to make reading a practice that is incorporated throughout my day. Having a single time for reading isn’t enough and it has become a ritual I like to incorporate as many places as I can.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Each day is different, but I know I can count on a handful of repeated situations that allow me to read consistently.</p>

<h2 id="early-mornings">Early Mornings</h2>

<p>Every morning, I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">get up at five</a>, grab a shower, and make a hot breakfast for myself. This early breakfast always consists of two eggs fried in a cast iron skillet and a banana. While the skillet is warming up and the eggs are cooking, I read. When they are finished cooking, I read while I eat. This is easily the most reliable time I have for reading. It’s a relaxed, ritualistic, and energizing time that is perfect for creating motivation for the day ahead.</p>

<h2 id="transitions">Transitions</h2>

<p>Whether it’s a few extra minutes before a meeting or a quick break between tasks, the transitional periods throughout the day serve as excellent times to grab a book. It may only be a single page, but one page here and there can add up quickly. The beauty of reclaiming these transitional times comes from what it replaces: social media and email checks. Instead of losing 10 minutes to cruising Twitter, I finish a chapter in my book.</p>

<h2 id="waiting">Waiting</h2>

<p>I have started taking a book with me whenever I leave the house. I’m early to most meetings and often find myself waiting for others to show up. Having a book with me means I can get a few more pages read instead of perusing blog articles or email on my phone.</p>

<h2 id="eob-ritual">EOB Ritual</h2>

<p>At the end of my workday, I go through an End Of Business ritual that helps me unwind and clear my head for spending time with my family. I have tried various tactics during this time, but I have found that learning is the best at hitting the brakes on my mental race car. And what better way to learn than to read? So I’ve made it a habit of reading for about 15 minutes before calling it a day.</p>

<h2 id="bedtime">Bedtime</h2>

<p>The least reliable of my reading times is likely the most consistent for others. I am sporadic at reading before bed, but it is another time that is easy to take advantage of and turn a few pages in a book.</p>

<h2 id="the-pattern">The Pattern?</h2>

<p>When I reflect on each of these scenarios I notice a recurring theme. In every instance, I have historically focused my eyes on a screen instead of a book. It’s easy to check my phone for a few minutes before bed or while I am eating breakfast. But if I pay attention to how I feel afterwards, I always prefer the feeling of accomplishment after having read a book to the feeling of inadequacy that comes from checking a screen.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<p>I find these moments bittersweet. They often result in something much better, but they also bring with them an extensive amount of rework. This was precisely my experience when I took on my second book, <em>Working With Ideas</em>.</p>

<p>I was working on the outline and collecting segments of content when I realized the medium for this content and its delivery system was wrong. It needed to reveal more emotion and story with more camaraderie than an e-book can provide. So I changed direction and turned it into a full video course with a community of idea workers to share the experience with.</p>

<p>I consider this my best work and I’m thrilled to share it with you. I’m so excited about it that I decided to make it possible to <a href="http://pre.workingwithideas.co">get the course for free</a>! To get started, you simply need to <a href="http://pre.workingwithideas.co">sign-up for the launch email</a> (which gets you $12 off by itself).</p>

We’ve come a long way since we met five years ago.

    <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/an-open-letter-to-productivity.jpeg" /><p>My friend,</p>

<p>We’ve come a long way since we met five years ago.<!--more--> And I cannot thank you enough for the clarity and direction you’ve given me through the multiple transitions and big decisions I have faced in recent years. Without the systems and tricks you’ve taught me, I would accomplish much less and fall short of numerous goals. For that, I am grateful.</p>

<p>I know I don’t always stick to the structure you’ve helped me build, but you’re always there when I realize I’ve stepped away. I know that if I trust the guidelines and follow them, my days are efficient and invigorating; and that makes me want to keep going and do more. It reveals my ability to do something great.</p>

<p>But sometimes I need space. I know you want me to be efficient with my calendar but there are periods when I need to blow some time with no expected outcomes. I need a little freedom. I need to be flexible and play once a while.</p>

<p>I think you would agree that margin is beneficial, but you often expect a measurable result when I take a break. I can understand that. We both know that taking time to re-energize can lead to greater gains elsewhere. But that’s my point: I can’t always look for the benefit of an activity. Why must everything have a defined positive outcome? Why not be content with the lack of definition and embrace spontaneity and play?</p>

<p>I want to continue our friendship, but with a different perspective. Let’s focus less on doing more and more on doing right. That likely means fewer projects, but I want them to be <em>better</em> projects. I know you’re with me here. But let’s also invite Play to our meetings. I’m aware of the love-hate relationship between you. Let’s work through that together. Between the three of us, I believe we can accomplish something awesome.</p>

<p>I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>Joe</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/reading-books-on-a-schedule.jpeg" /><p>For years I have wanted to read more books. Prolific readers rave about the benefits and world-renowned leaders often attribute their ideas and successes to their habit of reading, but to me the benefits of having read a lot of books  was secondary to the innate sense that a realm of knowledge and experience was available to me, but I was missing it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Missing out on something is not inherently bad. It is actually a good thing in many cases. With firehoses of input available at every turn today, we need to decide to miss out on some things. And the more we can cut, the more head space and time we have to expand our minds and work towards our goals in life. I will be the first to say I am bad at this. Resisting the constant pull of potential updates is a war I fight daily.</p>

<p>In time, I have cut back on these overwhelming streams of unnecessary input, but I have only done so successfully with the addition of a replacement habit: reading books. Frankly, I don’t have the self-control to pick up a book instead of my phone when the “just check” bug bites. I rely on staged environmental circumstances to make it happen. I leave my phone out of reach and keep a book readily available. That helps significantly, but taking it another step, I have committed to completing a book every two weeks.</p>

<p>This accomplishes two things. One, I need to read a significant portion of a book each day to hit my mark. Two, it forces me to look for time to read in the day. The combination of these two means I do not have near the time for social media and email as I did previously and instead use that time for books.</p>

<p>But there is a flaw in this design that I discovered early on. My procrastination tendency leads me to back loading the two-week period with higher page counts. This is mostly due to not knowing if I am on track to hit my goal on a daily basis. It appears simple to take the number of pages in the book and divide by 14 to know how far to read each day. But after day three or four, I start to lose track and do not want to continue recalculating where I should be.</p>

<p>Each time I start a new book, I create a new OmniFocus project for it. I have a series of tasks I complete after finishing a book. Since this project already exists, I took it to another level and added a “Read Book” group with subtasks for each day’s reading. With that group flagged, I know what today’s expected page count is by looking at <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-omnifocus-dashboard/">my Dashboard</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/reading-books-on-a-schedule/read-book-group.png" /></p>

<p>But reading a book every two weeks means I create these tasks quite frequently. And you can’t expect me to do that manually every time, can you? A new script was in order.</p>

<p>When run, it asks four questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the title of the book?</li>
  <li>How many pages are in the book?</li>
  <li>When do you want to start reading?</li>
  <li>When do you want to finish reading?</li>
</ol>

<p>Using these answers, the script breaks the book into the correct number of tasks (one per day), each having the same number of pages to read. It adds these to my OmniFocus inbox so I can copy/paste or move them as I like. It programmatically adds @Read as a context, but the script can be altered as needed to fit your system. <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts/tree/master/Read%20Book%20Tasks">This script</a> can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">OFScripts repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The result of this is a daily view of progress I need to make in order to hit my goal. Knowing the day’s goal forces me to make time and cut back on the less important, trivial actions.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<p>If you’re new to productivity or systems, then giving yourself a couple days to put these processes in place may pay off big and be well worth your time. Even if you’re a pro it can be helpful to make adjustments to how you do things with the intent of increasing efficiency, meaning, and output. I make tweaks to my structure frequently. But I need to remind myself of a lie that creeps up when I embark on one of these system alteration endeavors: <em>this is productive.</em></p>

<p>False. It is not productive. It is <em>meta-productive.</em> It feels productive because we are doing something that has meaning; this will make me a better, more efficient person. We are given a sense that we will be able to do more and live a better life, no matter how small the impact, in the future. But it doesn’t inherently make us more productive. It makes it possible, but it won’t make it happen on its own. It simply sets up the environment to be the best it can or should be for us to act on.</p>

<p>This is where the “meta” part comes in. We are completing tasks that allow us to complete tasks more efficiently or effectively. It’s one step removed from the real work to which we’ve committed.</p>

<p>But the deception here is the sense of accomplishment that comes after we have been <em>meta-productive</em>. We’ve done the work necessary to make us better in the future and that gives us the feeling that something important has been completed - even though we haven’t touched one important task the whole time. We get excited about this new or updated system because we’ve made the decisions that will help us accomplish something new or something big. But we haven’t taken an action on the thing itself.</p>

<p>Don’t fall for this feeling of completion after you’ve worked on a system. Don’t celebrate until you’ve worked on the items within it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/analog-writing-organization.jpeg" /><p>When I made the decision to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-science-and-experience-of-analog-writing/">embrace pen and paper</a>, the need for structure quickly showed its face. I wanted my writing to live in a single notebook, but that meant I needed a method of tracking progress on pieces without thumbing through the whole notebook.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The logical conclusion here is an index which allows me to see each composition and the headway I’ve made. That progression consists of three steps which need to be incorporated in the indicator. First is the initial draft: the dump of the ideas at the onset. Second is the editing process of the first draft, and the final step is to transcribe the writing to the computer for one last look. Once it is moved from paper to screen, the tracking process is handled digitally.</p>

<p>In practice, this means I need a list of articles augmented with the location within the notebook and the progress I’ve made on it. A simple page number will do for the location, but I wanted an evolving indicator for the progress meter. And since there are only three states to track, I went for the slow build of a star: “/” → “X” → “*”.</p>

<p>When there is no indicator, I know I have made a commitment to the piece but haven’t started writing. The “/” tells me I’ve finished the first draft. The “X” tells me the editing process as been completed. And the final “*” is a picture of completion when the transcription is finished. Altogether, this is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/analog-writing-organization/index.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Now, I can take the first few pages of any notebook to create this index over the life of the notebook. I could also add page numbers to any grouping of paper I feel inclined to use. Throw on top of this my want for good fountain pen paper and I was certain I would need to hack together a custom notebook or make compromises. But that’s not the case.</p>

<p>I found the notebook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=leuchtturm1917&amp;sprefix=leuchtturm1917%2Caps%2C166&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=joebuhlig-20">Leuchtturm</a>, that has all of these features plus a few I didn’t realize I wanted. They have a built-in index as well as page numbers. It’s high-quality paper and has dual bookmark ribbons, one for finding my index and one for the last used page. There’s even a slot in the back that acts as an inbox while I’m out and stickers to help with archiving the notebook. I haven’t made a decision about keeping these when I fill it, but having the ability to easily do so and knowing the quality of the notebook makes me consider long-term storage of my hand-written words. Though storage space will likely make my decision for me.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm-Master-Notebook-Hardcover-Dotted/dp/B003ENUIKC?tag=joebuhlig-20">Master Dot Grid</a> notebook because it’s larger and keeps my pages clean. The bigger pages allow me to see more of the piece at one time and requires less page turning when dictating the words into a microphone. It also fits nicely into the computer slot in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoon-Innovations-Backpack-Laptop-MCP3401BK/dp/B00LBYTMOY?tag=joebuhlig-20">backpack</a> which is perfect for writing ventures away from the house. I’m a big fan of the Dot Grid paper because it limits the markings on the page yet gives me a bit of structure to keep my words in line.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to write by hand and need an organizational structure for your writing, take a look at Leuchtturm. Their notebooks fit perfectly.</p>
