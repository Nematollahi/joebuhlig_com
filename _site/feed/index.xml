        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Merry-Christmas-2015.jpg" /><p>I’m thrilled to give you a gift for Christmas this year. I’ve wanted to do something like this for a long time and the opportunity is finally here.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I enjoy helping others and I’ve heard from a lot of people that <em>Working with OmniFocus</em> has finally showed them the tools they needed to put their life in perspective. Folks have shared stories about being able to start a business because of the principles shared in the book. One reader found treatment for a serious illness in their child because they were able to work clearly with the doctors. That blows my mind.</p>

<p>If you’ve been on the fence about buying the book, want to give yourself a Christmas present, or know someone who might benefit from reading it, here’s a discount code for you to use when buying <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a>. Use the code <code class="highlighter-rouge">Christmas15</code> when filling in your information and it will take $5 off the price. The code will be valid through the day after Christmas.</p>

<p>And if you’re willing, send me your story. I love hearing from you. Merry Christmas!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Monthly-Planning.jpg" /><p>We’re sneaking up on the annual goal setting push. It’s exciting to sit down and dream about what you want to do next year. But what if your life moves and changes too fast for annual goals?
<!--more--></p>

<p>Setting goals is something <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/an-alternative-to-annual-goals/">I’ve struggled with</a>. And it has generally been instigated by the company I worked for. I went through the typical annual review process when I worked in corporate and at the virtual company I worked for. You find it just about everywhere.</p>

<h2 id="annual-expectation">Annual Expectation</h2>

<p>It always felt like I did it because I <em>should</em>. I even completed a similar process personally because I thought it was the silver bullet to achieving more. I was wrong.</p>

<p>Annual planning doesn’t work for me. That’s one reason I’ve always struggled with it. Putting a plan together for how you’ll build new technology is fun, but often very inaccurate. It moves quickly and you learn a lot in the building process. That typically means that when 12 months have passed, I’ve discovered a new area to work on that is more beneficial or more advantageous. Year-end reviews typically involved a discussion of why I didn’t hit the original goals.</p>

<h2 id="move-to-monthly">Move to Monthly</h2>

<p>12 months is simply too long in my world. So I’ve scaled it back. I still set goals, but I turn those into projects and plan them month by month. And most of those projects are only two or three months long.</p>

<p>Because I can usually see the next two - sometimes three - projects that are coming up, I go ahead and plan those out. I’m only looking at the next seven or eight months at a time, and even those later months will typically change a few times before I complete them.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-looks-like">What It Looks Like</h2>

<p>I keep a simple list of my monthly goals. Each goal is a single line item with a brief description. For the GTD fans, this is synonymous with my 30,000 Horizon of Focus. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MonthlyPlanning_MonthlyPlan.jpg" /></p>

<p>I have multiple goals per month. I put the name of the month in the title of the task so I can keep them in order, and that’s all it takes for me to stay on track. When I see this list, I know what’s coming up and I can plan my days and weeks appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="working-the-plan">Working The Plan</h2>

<p>A plan is worthless if it isn’t reviewed, so I read each line item once a week and let that dictate what I work on each day. I make sure that I’m on track and that the direction I’ve chosen is still accurate. I don’t get bent out of shape when I change the plan for the next four months; I’m being realistic with myself.</p>

<p>When I’m finished looking over the Monthly Plan, I translate it into a plan for the upcoming week - my Weekly Plan. The Weekly Plan is a simple two or three item list of the things I need to complete next week in order to make progress on the Monthly Plan. It breaks it down into pieces I can digest that week.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MonthlyPlanning_WeeklyPlan.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="overkill">Overkill</h2>

<p>I’m terrible at remembering, that’s why I need these systems. This sounds like a lot of work even for me, but here’s the point: 12 months is too far out, and I need guidance. I use this month by month plan to help me decide what to work on each day. It’s a single, uncluttered list that is easily reviewed and updated. I don’t want complicated. I want it to keep my head on straight and help me hit my goals. If it does that, it’s a success.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/TextExpander-Snippet-Nomenclature.jpg" /><p>I currently have 217 snippets in TextExpander. That’s likely not a big number for some people, but for my forgetful mind it’s a lot. To keep them straight, I use a simple nomenclature for my snippet abbreviations.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The general premise is to use a short group indicator followed by a more specific identifier. It’s kind of like tagging. I still use groups in TextExpander to keep them clean, but this helps me remember them.</p>

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>

<p>There are some URLs that I type a lot. I use the links to <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a>, <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">OFScripts</a>, this website, and my email accounts (Gmail) daily, so I added them to TextExpander. I use the group indicator <code class="highlighter-rouge">link</code> and an identifier like <code class="highlighter-rouge">wwo</code> to help me remember them. So I would type <code class="highlighter-rouge">link.wwo</code> to get <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">link.home = http://joebuhlig.com

link.tools = https://tools.joebuhlig.com

link.pod = http://joebuhlig.com/whaddyaknowjoe/

link.wwo = https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/

link.ofscripts = https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>

<p>All of my writing is done in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> because I can get it into HTML so easily. It’s only natural that I have a few snippets to make this even easier. To help me remember them, I use the group indicator <code class="highlighter-rouge">md</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*This one uses two snippets that I'll mention later*
md.curtab = [%snippet:xcurtitle%](%snippet:xcurlink%)

md.image = ![%|](/assets/posts_extra/)

md.reddit = [Discuss this on Reddit.](%filltext:name=Insert link to Reddit discussion%)</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>

<p>A couple months ago I moved from WordPress to a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/from-wordpress-google-to-jekyll-piwik/">static site with Jekyll</a>. Part of the Jekyll environment involves “Front Matter” which is comprised of <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a>. Every time I create a new article or podcast, I add this to the top of the markdown file. In my scenario, I also need to create the slug for the article. I’ve create the following snippets with the group indicator <code class="highlighter-rouge">yaml</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*For the slug, you first need to copy the text to be slugified.*
*I usually just copy the title of the article.*

yaml.slug = Javascript Snippet

var text = TextExpander.pasteboardText;
text = text.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '');
var newtext = text.split(" ").join("-");
TextExpander.appendOutput("/" + newtext.toLowerCase() + "/");</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">yaml.blog =

---</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>I write a lot of code. I build my own websites and do freelance development. I use a number of languages, so I’ve created group indicators for each language: <code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code> for HTML, <code class="highlighter-rouge">css</code> for CSS, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rb</code> for Ruby, <code class="highlighter-rouge">py</code> for Python, and so on. And because HTML can get to be big, I broke it into groupings for individual tags as well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">a.n = &lt;a href=""&gt;%|&lt;/a&gt;

p.n = &lt;p&gt;%|&lt;/p&gt;

p.class = &lt;p class=""&gt;%|&lt;/p&gt;

div.n = &lt;div&gt;%|&lt;/div&gt;

html.base = &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;%|&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

html.clear = &lt;div class="clear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

html.img = &lt;img src="%|" /&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="ip-addresses">IP Addresses</h2>

<p>Along with coding, I have a number of IP addresses to keep track of. I don’t like referencing a table somewhere or even looking them up in 1Password. I prefer to create shortcuts to them with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ip</code> as the indicator.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ip.jb = XX.XX.XX.XX

ip.tools = XX.XX.XX.XX

ip.clientname = XX.XX.XX.XX

*You didn't think I'd actually share them, did you?*</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="catchallscripts">Catchall/Scripts</h2>

<p>There are a lot of cases when I just want something short and it doesn’t have to be grouped because I use them so much. Formatted dates are great and so are a few scripts I run frequently. I simply use <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> at the start of the snippet.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*Today's date in the format of YYYYMMDD*
xtd = 20151211

*Next Monday's date in the format of YYYYMMDD. I have one for each day of the week.*
xnm = 20151214</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*The title of the current page in Safari*
xcurtitle = Applescript

tell application "Safari"
    set theName to name of front document
    return theName
end tell</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*The URL of the current page in Safari. It removes any querystrings as well.*
xcurlink = Applescript

tell application "Safari"
    set theName to name of front document
    set theURL to URL of front document
    set oldDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "?"
    set theArray to every text item of theURL
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelimiters
    set theURL to item 1 of theArray
    return theURL
end tell</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">xplan = Plan project for 

xwait = Waiting for 

xas = AppleScript

xgh = GitHub

xof = OmniFocus</code></pre></figure>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Keeping-Up-with-Ideas.jpg" /><p>Ideas are sometimes hard to come up with. But what happens when you have so many that you get lost? You have all these ideas begging you for attention and it becomes unclear which ones you should take on and which ones you should let go.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I don’t know how to tackle this issue with anything other than a list. But a list is no good if you don’t trust it. You have to trust that you’ll add items to it and you have to trust that you’ll come back to it. There may be mental freedom in writing it down, but if you never look at it again you’ve just conned yourself into forgetting.</p>

<h2 id="analog-vs-digital">Analog vs Digital</h2>

<p>Where you keep this list doesn’t matter, as long as it works for you. Most people assume that I do everything digitally. False. Many times I’m writing notes or drawing pictures on a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">note card</a>. I convert it later, but I still prefer pen and paper.</p>

<p>Choose the process that works for you. If you’re using a paper calendar, you’ll likely want to keep this list on paper as well. If you don’t have a printer, you’ll probably find an app for it.</p>

<h2 id="capture">Capture</h2>

<p>No matter which form of list keeping you use, it’s imperative that you keep something around to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-capture/">grab these ideas</a> when they come. And they <em>will</em> hit you at inopportune times. Think about how you’ll capture ideas when you’re driving your car or taking a shower. If you don’t have a plan, you’ll start losing them.</p>

<h2 id="building-trust">Building Trust</h2>

<p>The only way you’ll build trust in your new list is to read through it regularly. I’ve found weekly to be a great starting point. It doesn’t matter when, so long as you do it. Schedule a time if you have to, but make sure you don’t forget this step; it is the most vital part of the process.</p>

<p>With consistent review, you begin to trust that your ideas aren’t lost after you write them down. You will come back to them. And as a nice bonus, you’ll start to have more ideas as you go through the list. Seeing them all together typically prompts new ones to form.</p>

<h2 id="making-decisions">Making Decisions</h2>

<p>If you create this list, collect ideas for it, and trust it, it’s still worthless if you never activate an idea. But when do you start working on an idea and how do you know which one to pick?</p>

<p>Timing is the easy part. You can only choose to work on an idea if you have time (or make time) for it. If you decide to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">get up early</a> to work on that new side project, you know when you’ll work on it. If you feel overwhelmed by your workload as it is, you need to focus on completing current projects before you take on a new one.</p>

<p>Deciding which idea to pursue is the hard part. If possible, you want the idea to have purpose and hold your interest. If there’s no strategic or direct value in it, why work on it? It should either be a building block to something else or a straightforward product that you’ll enjoy.</p>

<p>When you find yourself having a lot of new ideas, take advantage of it. Write them down, because they don’t always come when you want them.</p>

<p>Then I started this blog. People say that one benefit of writing is a better understanding of your own thoughts. It’s true. I’ve learned a lot about myself since starting to blog, and it’s one of the primary reasons I recommend blogging to others.</p>

<p>But writing on a schedule or regularly creating anything requires a lot of new ideas. When you start, you may have a backlog of these that you’ve been thinking about. But at some point you’ll need more. How do you plan to generate them?</p>

<p>Do a quick search for “releasing creative energy” and you’ll find a lot of articles on how to develop more ideas - going on a walk, meditating, getting outside, drinking coffee, people watching, and so on.</p>

<p>These are great tips to help clear your mind and allow you to find and connect new dots. But I’ve found that there’s more to it than <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/13/">letting my mind wander</a>. Sometimes I need to take action to kick off creativity flow.</p>

<h2 id="check-things-off">Check Things Off</h2>

<p>Think about the most recent big project you completed. What did you do after it was checked off? Celebrate? Take a week off? Lie low for a while?</p>

<p>And how did you feel when it was done? After a big push like I did for <em><a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">Working with OmniFocus</a></em>, I felt a huge weight lift and I started wondering what would come next. I had been working so hard for so long that not having that big project in front of me gave me a sense of freedom and excitement. It released my mind to go on to the next thing, which kicked off creative flow.</p>

<h2 id="analog-brainstorming">Analog Brainstorming</h2>

<p>There’s something about leaving ink on a piece of paper that helps my mind process thoughts more clearly. The process of analog writing is so natural that I can move from one idea to the other with very little friction. Even hitting a keyboard shortcut to add a node to a mindmap can create enough resistance to slow my wandering brain and interfere with the next idea. I have two things to think about - the idea itself and the process of entering that idea. (Talk about high maintenance.)</p>

<p>Between paper and whiteboards, I’m free to roam from one topic or crazy idea to another with zero resistance to connecting the next dot. Writing by hand is natural; when I need an idea for something, I go analog and let my mind meander.</p>

<p>Note: a timer is helpful here. It can eliminate the worry of spending too much time daydreaming.</p>

<h2 id="talk-about-it">Talk About It</h2>

<p>I often forget this step or don’t want to do it, but telling friends about your ideas can spark more ideas. A different perspective on a topic can lead to more connections, developing your idea into something more complete.</p>

<p>I don’t like to do this. What if someone steals my idea? I don’t want something I’ve come up with being taken from me. But I’ve found that rarely happens. If I stick to my trusted circle of mentors and friendships, it’s not an issue.</p>

<h2 id="collect">Collect</h2>

<p>The more inputs and experiences you can bring into your mind, the more points you have to connect. This is partly why going for a walk, getting outside, and watching people can drive new ideas. These experiences provoke your mind to roam and give you new information to connect to your previous ideas and thoughts.</p>

<p>The more information you can collect about your topic and the more experiences you have, the more ingredients you have to formulate and expand your idea.</p>

<p>My goal in all of these scenarios is to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">free my mind</a> to have ideas. If I’m able to think clearly without worry, I can create more freely.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Breaking-the-Cycle.jpg" /><p>It’s time for a confession: I’m addicted to my phone. I want to check Twitter every five minutes and find myself refreshing Feedly every ten. And I hate it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve developed a habit of always wondering if there is something that needs my response. If someone asks me a question on Twitter, I want to get back to them right away. I don’t want them waiting on me. I don’t like being the one that holds up the line.</p>

<h2 id="steps-to-building-a-habit">Steps to building a habit</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of research behind building habits, but it doesn’t have to apply only to good habits. Understanding this cycle can help break bad habits as well. Break one of the steps and the habit stops.</p>

<h3 id="trigger">1. Trigger</h3>

<p>I love helping. Finding ways to solve problems for others will motivate me to work all day, every day. The downside is that I will sometimes go looking for problems that need to be solved. I primarily look for these problems in my own systems and tools, so the trigger is simply wondering if someone found an issue or has a question.</p>

<h3 id="reaction">2. Reaction</h3>

<p>My reaction to this trigger is to solve the problem or look for a problem. Whenever I wonder if there is a problem that needs solved or I think that a question might have popped up, I check the various places where a problem or question could arise. In my case, that’s mostly Twitter, Reddit, or email.</p>

<h3 id="treat">3. Treat</h3>

<p>Much like our dog gets treats when he does a trick, I get a treat when I solve a problem or answer a question. People tend to say thank you or show appreciation when you help out and that small incentive makes me want to keep helping. The trigger has been set off again.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-the-cycle">Breaking the cycle</h2>

<p>Scientists in agriculture have become really good at breaking the life cycle of insects. Whether it’s interrupting their mating season, creating a bad environment for eggs, or not allowing one of the metamorphosis steps, they can find ways to keep the pests from propagating and damaging crops.</p>

<p>It’s this cycle interruption that I’m attempting to put in place. Just telling myself not to  wonder will not likely happen. The thought enters faster than I can stop it, so I need to stop my reaction to the trigger - looking at social media and email. My primary means of checking is my phone and the best way to keep me off my phone is to leave it out of my reach. I’m much too lazy to get up just to check Twitter.</p>

<p>While I’m at work I can keep my phone across the room since I don’t usually check things on my Mac. I can leave it in my office when I go upstairs for lunch. After work, I have designated a place for it to land. If it’s not in my pocket, I’m less likely to get it and check things.</p>

<p>My hope is that by breaking this cycle, I’ll be more present with my family and break the habit. I know that my attention has fallen away from them when they need it. I’m not okay with that.</p>

<p>Tim Stringer, founder of Learn OmniFocus, recently invited me to do a live webinar about my OmniFocus setup on the site and add to this growing repository of content. I was thrilled and  honored to share.</p>

<p>In the recording below you’ll see normal stuff like setting up projects and contexts, but I also emphasize the importance of doing regular reviews and share a script I’ve written to help. I like doing reviews on set days, so I needed to be able to move the Next Review Date of a project to match my scheduled review date. If you’re interested in this script or some of the others I mention in the webinar, you can <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">find them on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">Working with Omnifocus</a>, this is one of the most complete overviews of my entire system. Tim Stringer has generously given me the feed to share with you, so check it out.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve been working long hours for the last couple months to make <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a> happen. There were late nights, early mornings, and long afternoons. Blood, sweat, tears, sickness and exhaustion all came into play at some point. And I’ve been thrilled at the response.</p>

<p>Many of you have sent me emails and joined the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/joebuhlig/comments/3rhedi/working_with_omnifocus/">Reddit discussion</a> to let me know what you think of the book. I have received emails from folks who have changed their perspective on how they work and look for better ways to manage their tasks. They are heartfelt and grateful. They drive me to do more and help anywhere I can. It’s these people that keep me excited about the work I do.</p>

<p>And I will continue to look for ways to do that, but not right now. After the hard work that’s gone into this and the unending support that my family has given me over the past months, it’s time to take a short break and give to them. I’ll be back at it next week, but I’m taking a long weekend to recoup.  Thank you for all the great feedback, it’s been a wild ride.</p>

<p>It’s been down to the wire, but it’s finally here - <em>Working with OmniFocus</em>. A book that takes you through my entire system. It’s not for someone looking for a how-to manual for OmniFocus, but for those looking to understand the deeper concepts and nuances of the tool.</p>

<p>I’m super excited that it’s finally here! I’ve spent most of my editing time trying to make sure that it’s packed full of details and examples. The more real I can be with you, the better you can understand how it works.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Favorite-Workflows.jpg" /><p>I’ve received a number of requests for more detail around my use of <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow</a> (<a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">iTunes</a>). I’ve said that it saves time, but here are some details.
<!--more--></p>

<p>If I find myself doing something repeatedly, I look for a way to automate it. Since AppleScripting isn’t possible on iOS, I turn to Workflow for some of the same functionality. Here are my heavy hitter workflows.</p>

<h2 id="headed-home">Headed Home</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/efa5488ee8e44687ad75e628a5ba1b1d">Headed Home Workflow</a></p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Workflow_Headed-Home.png" /></p>

<p>There a quite a few instances each week when I’m out of the house without a specific time that I’m expected to return. My wife often needs to know when I’m headed home so she can plan accordingly. In those cases, I use this workflow to let her know I’m on my way and how long it should be before I get there. This workflow is one of three that I keep in the Today View for easy access because I use it so frequently.</p>

<h2 id="copy-base-url">Copy Base URL</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/1de51ad711624c1daace1159e2abab4e">Copy Base URL Workflow</a></p>

<p>This is a rare case when I introduce more steps to a process in order to get a cleaner result. Many times I need to copy a URL but I really don’t like having extra querystring parameters at the end of the URL. I use this to expand shortened URLS and strip the extra nonsense off the end. Then it’s added to my clipboard.</p>

<h2 id="save-to-dropbox">Save to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/db653ceda86942328b802cce58f6b6ed">Save to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>Any time I run across a file (typically a PDF) on my phone that I want to save to DropBox, I use this. I could do the “Open in…” thing, but I know where I want it to go in DropBox before I even start - my DropBox inbox. This workflow takes the file and drops it into my inbox. It’s faster than everything else I’ve tried.</p>

<h2 id="share-title--twitter">Share Title &amp; Twitter</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/44904f69761047ae8fb3d8a741ff08d6">Share Title &amp; Twitter Workflow</a></p>

<p>I have another <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/workflow-to-share-articles-with-twitter-handle/">one similar to this</a> that shares an article with a Twitter handle and asks for a comment about the article. If I don’t have a specific thought about an article but still want to share it, I use this instead. It puts the title of the article in quotes, adds a link to the article, and searches the page for a Twitter handle to include at the end of the tweet.</p>

<h2 id="instatweet">InstaTweet</h2>

<p>When I want to share a photo on Instagram and Twitter I know I can select Twitter from Instagram, but I prefer to embed them directly. This workflow allows me to select the photo, add a caption, and send it both places at once.</p>

<h2 id="article-to-pdf">Article to PDF</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/2ec2ca89dbad4c4db754788f6fccae9d">Article to PDF Workflow</a></p>

<p>This is a small piece of my research storage mechanism. To save an article  for a project I’m working on, I run this workflow which saves it as a PDF in my DropBox inbox. These are processed during my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a> and are often moved to project folders.</p>

<h2 id="take-pic-to-dropbox">Take Pic to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/c348878f30b24163afc1d4cbdce15b87">Take Pic to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>This is similar to the Article to PDF workflow, but it opens the camera. I take a picture and it is immediately sent to my DropBox inbox. This is really handy if I want to save a picture of a restaurant menu or a bag of coffee. When I process these, I move them to their respective locations in my file structure for reference.</p>

<h2 id="send-pic-to-dropbox">Send Pic to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/ec13b1062c5d47a1813a348ed659c27c">Send Pic to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>Just like the previous workflow, this adds a picture to my DropBox inbox but allows me to select pictures from my photo library. There are times when I remember taking a picture that I want to use for a project. This helps me get them into DropBox quickly and easily.</p>

<h2 id="screenshot-to-dropbox">Screenshot to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/43d066eb6d194620b1ed4f9134d96810">Screenshot to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>I’m building a lot of websites lately and part of my process involves looking for web design inspiration. This means I’m taking a lot of screenshots of other websites. I keep this workflow in my Today View so I can take the screenshot, swipe down, and send it to DropBox right away.</p>
