But, apparently, running three shows of my own isn’t enough. I started doing some interviews on other shows and the first of these to release is my chat with Jay Miller over on the <a href="https://productivityintech.com/pitpodcast/64">Productivity in Tech</a> podcast.

<p>Jay and I talk about a wide variety of topics involving my development work, how he should get into development, the work I’m kicking off on <a href="https://productivityguild.com">Productivity Guild</a>, digital vs. analog task management, and a number of tangents around productivity in general. It’s a good time. You should <a href="https://productivityintech.com/pitpodcast/64">check it out</a>.</p>
