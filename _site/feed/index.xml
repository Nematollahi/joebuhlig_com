<h2 id="working-with-omnifocus">Working with OmniFocus</h2>

<p>This is my favorite accomplishment of 2015. I had been wanting to write a book for a long time but never had the time. It seems that there were a lot of you interested in reading it as well. In two short months, there were 667 copies of <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a> sold! I wasn’t expecting anywhere near that number when I started, and I’ve been overwhelmed by the feedback. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="ha-tech">H&amp;A Tech</h2>

<p>In August, I left the company I was working for and started my own business. It was a fast and unnerving transition, but I’m thrilled to be where I am today. I’m able to work on the projects I love and build things with little or no delay. If I get a crazy idea, I can pursue it without worrying about politics or the red tape of company approvals. I wish I could have done this sooner.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Writing-a-Book-with-GitHub.jpg" /><p>A lot of time and effort go into writing a book. It gets even harder when you need to collaborate with your editor and make revisions.
<!--more--></p>

<p>All of the edits must be reviewed and approved. Do you keep the change or do you toss it? Multiply this by hundreds of edits (or in my case thousands) and the task is enormous. Even when you think you nailed a paragraph, it can come back shredded (that means it’s better in the end, right?).</p>

<p>When I wrote <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a> I used GitHub to manage all of the revisions and help me see the edits. I was doing all of my writing for the blog in Markdown and I didn’t want to change that workflow for the book.  It turned out to be a great choice.</p>

<h2 id="file-layout">File Layout</h2>

<p>I kept the file structure for the book really simple. A single markdown file for the outline and a single file for each chapter. I wrote the first draft for the entire book before I went back to start editing. When I finished editing each chapter I uploaded a copy of it to a DropBox folder I share with my editor. That allowed her to get started while I kept editing the later chapters.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-tiny" src="/assets/posts_extra/Writing a Book with GitHub/file_structure.jpg" /></p>

<p>I created a local git repository on my computer with the GitHub for Mac application. I could do it via command line, but I like the UI that comes with the app. Every time I made edits to the book, I committed the changes to save a history of the work I was doing.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-edits">Receiving Edits</h2>

<p>When my editor finished each chapter, she let me know via email or text. I created a new branch in my local repository that I used to overwrite my version of the chapter with hers. That gave me her edits on my machine with the GitHub application waiting for me to merge those changes. I read through each edit and made decisions.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Writing a Book with GitHub/github_edits.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was simple to see any adds, deletes, or comments that she made. The interface clearly showed what had been done to the file. If I needed to revise what she had done, I could jump over to the file in Sublime Text, make the edits, and save it. When I was done acting on her edits, I committed the changes and then merged them into my master branch in GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="version-history">Version History</h2>

<p>A big benefit of this process is the version history. I can look back on every commit I have made and roll back to that point in time. It keeps each revision and allows me to come back to them as needed. This is a huge load off of my brain. I don’t have to worry about making a change - I know I can always undo it or look back on what I did and see the progression.</p>

<p>I plan to use this method for any books I write in the future. I use GitHub quite a bit, so I’m comfortable with it and it makes the editing process painless. Well, at least logistically.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Trust-and-Let-Loose.jpg" /><p>It takes time to develop consistency in a task management system. I forget. I climb back on the horse, but fall off again. It looks easy - and it is at times - but other times it feels like one more item on my to-do list.
<!--more--></p>

<p>All of the apps and systems are nice, but I go through seasons with them. People see my systems and might think I have it all together. I don’t. I forget things all the time. It’s why I gravitate to the structure: it gives me a place to put things so I can come back to them.</p>

<p>There are times when I fail to stick to them. It’s at those times that I drop the ball and miss a deadline, or disappoint my family. It sometimes takes a painful reminder to push me back into the lists. I know I can trust them, but I don’t always.</p>

<p>But the time I spend away from them is continually growing shorter. I climb back into the cockpit more quickly each time. If I continue to collect my thoughts and do something about them, I know they’re taken care of. I know that I can go play with my girls without being concerned about work.</p>

<p>Here is one of the deterrents to GTD: You put a system together, but a big urgent project comes up and you put the structure aside. A month goes by before you notice that thoughts about work are invading your family time and that when you’re at work all you want to do is go home. You come back to the system and start to find clarity again.</p>

<p>It takes time to trust the system in all seasons. I would say it takes years of developing your personal system before you can trust it in every circumstance. This ongoing cycle of leaving and returning builds the trust you need to mentally let go.</p>

<p>Develop a system you can trust and let loose.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Bad-Bar-Charts.jpg" /><p>In previous roles I worked on data analysis and visualization. When you boil it down, that just means I was well versed in Excel and building charts.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I love the challenge of working on a chart until it displays the data honestly. That also means I notice bad designs in charts. There are many ways to skew results with chart design and they all make me see red. If you see a chart with one of these aspects, either ignore it or rebuild it.</p>

<h2 id="non-zero-based-scale">Non-Zero Based Scale</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/nonzero_baseline.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is one of the biggest culprits in bad charts. It’s easy to change the baseline of a chart and make it look like there’s a big difference between two segments. In the chart above, it looks like “Unsure” is drastically overpowering the “Unlikely” category. But if we change the chart to a zero-based axis, we can see that the difference is fairly small.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/zero_baseline.jpg" /></p>

<p>Now it’s a lot harder to see the difference between the categories, but it provides a more accurate picture of what’s going on because the visual matches the real data.</p>

<h2 id="varying-width-bars">Varying Width Bars</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/bar_width.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is more subtle but it can make a big impact on how the outcome is perceived. If you make the already taller bars wider than the others, you increase the visual effect on the viewer and leave them with an exaggerated perception of the data.</p>

<h2 id="unnecessary-lines">Unnecessary Lines</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/extra_lines.jpg" /></p>

<p>In the same way that a non-zero based scale alters the view of the data, a scale that goes too high can also mislead you to thinking there is no difference between two data points. You want the scale to go from zero to the lowest possible number while still allowing room for the entirety of  the bars.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/removed_extra_lines.jpg" /></p>

<p>We can now see that Minnesota has a decent lead on the others. But we couldn’t draw that conclusion until the scale was set appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="inconsistent-scale">Inconsistent scale</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/inconsistent_scale.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you don’t have all the data points (or don’t like them), you either need to forego the chart entirely or be honest. I have seen a similar chart used to show exponential growth of membership when in reality the membership growth rate was fairly consistent. Don’t lie with the data.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/consistent_scale.jpg" /></p>

<p>When you include all of the data points, you can see a big difference. Your perception of the first is that the pace is picking up fast. The second chart shows that the rate of increase is normalized.</p>

<h2 id="d">3D</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/3d.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is just bad design. It’s hard to get a feel for the difference in the bars because our eyes are trying to follow the perceived lines on the chart. And it looks bad. Don’t do it.</p>

<p>Overall, these are really simple fixes. But they can have a major impact on the viewer and how they perceive the data. Don’t lie with a visual. If the data doesn’t show what you want, then you have bigger decisions to make. Get to work and change your methods to get to your desired outcome. Don’t fabricate positive results.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Merry-Christmas-2015.jpg" /><p>I’m thrilled to give you a gift for Christmas this year. I’ve wanted to do something like this for a long time and the opportunity is finally here.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I enjoy helping others and I’ve heard from a lot of people that <em>Working with OmniFocus</em> has finally showed them the tools they needed to put their life in perspective. Folks have shared stories about being able to start a business because of the principles shared in the book. One reader found treatment for a serious illness in their child because they were able to work clearly with the doctors. That blows my mind.</p>

<p>If you’ve been on the fence about buying the book, want to give yourself a Christmas present, or know someone who might benefit from reading it, here’s a discount code for you to use when buying <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a>. Use the code <code class="highlighter-rouge">Christmas15</code> when filling in your information and it will take $5 off the price. The code will be valid through the day after Christmas.</p>

<p>And if you’re willing, send me your story. I love hearing from you. Merry Christmas!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Monthly-Planning.jpg" /><p>We’re sneaking up on the annual goal setting push. It’s exciting to sit down and dream about what you want to do next year. But what if your life moves and changes too fast for annual goals?
<!--more--></p>

<p>Setting goals is something <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/an-alternative-to-annual-goals/">I’ve struggled with</a>. And it has generally been instigated by the company I worked for. I went through the typical annual review process when I worked in corporate and at the virtual company I worked for. You find it just about everywhere.</p>

<h2 id="annual-expectation">Annual Expectation</h2>

<p>It always felt like I did it because I <em>should</em>. I even completed a similar process personally because I thought it was the silver bullet to achieving more. I was wrong.</p>

<p>Annual planning doesn’t work for me. That’s one reason I’ve always struggled with it. Putting a plan together for how you’ll build new technology is fun, but often very inaccurate. It moves quickly and you learn a lot in the building process. That typically means that when 12 months have passed, I’ve discovered a new area to work on that is more beneficial or more advantageous. Year-end reviews typically involved a discussion of why I didn’t hit the original goals.</p>

<h2 id="move-to-monthly">Move to Monthly</h2>

<p>12 months is simply too long in my world. So I’ve scaled it back. I still set goals, but I turn those into projects and plan them month by month. And most of those projects are only two or three months long.</p>

<p>Because I can usually see the next two - sometimes three - projects that are coming up, I go ahead and plan those out. I’m only looking at the next seven or eight months at a time, and even those later months will typically change a few times before I complete them.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-looks-like">What It Looks Like</h2>

<p>I keep a simple list of my monthly goals. Each goal is a single line item with a brief description. For the GTD fans, this is synonymous with my 30,000 Horizon of Focus. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MonthlyPlanning_MonthlyPlan.jpg" /></p>

<p>I have multiple goals per month. I put the name of the month in the title of the task so I can keep them in order, and that’s all it takes for me to stay on track. When I see this list, I know what’s coming up and I can plan my days and weeks appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="working-the-plan">Working The Plan</h2>

<p>A plan is worthless if it isn’t reviewed, so I read each line item once a week and let that dictate what I work on each day. I make sure that I’m on track and that the direction I’ve chosen is still accurate. I don’t get bent out of shape when I change the plan for the next four months; I’m being realistic with myself.</p>

<p>When I’m finished looking over the Monthly Plan, I translate it into a plan for the upcoming week - my Weekly Plan. The Weekly Plan is a simple two or three item list of the things I need to complete next week in order to make progress on the Monthly Plan. It breaks it down into pieces I can digest that week.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MonthlyPlanning_WeeklyPlan.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="overkill">Overkill</h2>

<p>I’m terrible at remembering, that’s why I need these systems. This sounds like a lot of work even for me, but here’s the point: 12 months is too far out, and I need guidance. I use this month by month plan to help me decide what to work on each day. It’s a single, uncluttered list that is easily reviewed and updated. I don’t want complicated. I want it to keep my head on straight and help me hit my goals. If it does that, it’s a success.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/TextExpander-Snippet-Nomenclature.jpg" /><p>I currently have 217 snippets in TextExpander. That’s likely not a big number for some people, but for my forgetful mind it’s a lot. To keep them straight, I use a simple nomenclature for my snippet abbreviations.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The general premise is to use a short group indicator followed by a more specific identifier. It’s kind of like tagging. I still use groups in TextExpander to keep them clean, but this helps me remember them.</p>

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>

<p>There are some URLs that I type a lot. I use the links to <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a>, <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">OFScripts</a>, this website, and my email accounts (Gmail) daily, so I added them to TextExpander. I use the group indicator <code class="highlighter-rouge">link</code> and an identifier like <code class="highlighter-rouge">wwo</code> to help me remember them. So I would type <code class="highlighter-rouge">link.wwo</code> to get <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">link.home = http://joebuhlig.com

link.tools = https://tools.joebuhlig.com

link.pod = http://joebuhlig.com/whaddyaknowjoe/

link.wwo = https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/

link.ofscripts = https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>

<p>All of my writing is done in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> because I can get it into HTML so easily. It’s only natural that I have a few snippets to make this even easier. To help me remember them, I use the group indicator <code class="highlighter-rouge">md</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*This one uses two snippets that I'll mention later*
md.curtab = [%snippet:xcurtitle%](%snippet:xcurlink%)

md.image = ![%|](/assets/posts_extra/)

md.reddit = [Discuss this on Reddit.](%filltext:name=Insert link to Reddit discussion%)</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>

<p>A couple months ago I moved from WordPress to a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/from-wordpress-google-to-jekyll-piwik/">static site with Jekyll</a>. Part of the Jekyll environment involves “Front Matter” which is comprised of <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a>. Every time I create a new article or podcast, I add this to the top of the markdown file. In my scenario, I also need to create the slug for the article. I’ve create the following snippets with the group indicator <code class="highlighter-rouge">yaml</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*For the slug, you first need to copy the text to be slugified.*
*I usually just copy the title of the article.*

yaml.slug = Javascript Snippet

var text = TextExpander.pasteboardText;
text = text.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '');
var newtext = text.split(" ").join("-");
TextExpander.appendOutput("/" + newtext.toLowerCase() + "/");</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">yaml.blog =

---</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>I write a lot of code. I build my own websites and do freelance development. I use a number of languages, so I’ve created group indicators for each language: <code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code> for HTML, <code class="highlighter-rouge">css</code> for CSS, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rb</code> for Ruby, <code class="highlighter-rouge">py</code> for Python, and so on. And because HTML can get to be big, I broke it into groupings for individual tags as well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">a.n = &lt;a href=""&gt;%|&lt;/a&gt;

p.n = &lt;p&gt;%|&lt;/p&gt;

p.class = &lt;p class=""&gt;%|&lt;/p&gt;

div.n = &lt;div&gt;%|&lt;/div&gt;

html.base = &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;%|&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

html.clear = &lt;div class="clear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

html.img = &lt;img src="%|" /&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="ip-addresses">IP Addresses</h2>

<p>Along with coding, I have a number of IP addresses to keep track of. I don’t like referencing a table somewhere or even looking them up in 1Password. I prefer to create shortcuts to them with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ip</code> as the indicator.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ip.jb = XX.XX.XX.XX

ip.tools = XX.XX.XX.XX

ip.clientname = XX.XX.XX.XX

*You didn't think I'd actually share them, did you?*</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="catchallscripts">Catchall/Scripts</h2>

<p>There are a lot of cases when I just want something short and it doesn’t have to be grouped because I use them so much. Formatted dates are great and so are a few scripts I run frequently. I simply use <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> at the start of the snippet.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*Today's date in the format of YYYYMMDD*
xtd = 20151211

*Next Monday's date in the format of YYYYMMDD. I have one for each day of the week.*
xnm = 20151214</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*The title of the current page in Safari*
xcurtitle = Applescript

tell application "Safari"
    set theName to name of front document
    return theName
end tell</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*The URL of the current page in Safari. It removes any querystrings as well.*
xcurlink = Applescript

tell application "Safari"
    set theName to name of front document
    set theURL to URL of front document
    set oldDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "?"
    set theArray to every text item of theURL
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelimiters
    set theURL to item 1 of theArray
    return theURL
end tell</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">xplan = Plan project for 

xwait = Waiting for 

xas = AppleScript

xgh = GitHub

xof = OmniFocus</code></pre></figure>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Keeping-Up-with-Ideas.jpg" /><p>Ideas are sometimes hard to come up with. But what happens when you have so many that you get lost? You have all these ideas begging you for attention and it becomes unclear which ones you should take on and which ones you should let go.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I don’t know how to tackle this issue with anything other than a list. But a list is no good if you don’t trust it. You have to trust that you’ll add items to it and you have to trust that you’ll come back to it. There may be mental freedom in writing it down, but if you never look at it again you’ve just conned yourself into forgetting.</p>

<h2 id="analog-vs-digital">Analog vs Digital</h2>

<p>Where you keep this list doesn’t matter, as long as it works for you. Most people assume that I do everything digitally. False. Many times I’m writing notes or drawing pictures on a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">note card</a>. I convert it later, but I still prefer pen and paper.</p>

<p>Choose the process that works for you. If you’re using a paper calendar, you’ll likely want to keep this list on paper as well. If you don’t have a printer, you’ll probably find an app for it.</p>

<h2 id="capture">Capture</h2>

<p>No matter which form of list keeping you use, it’s imperative that you keep something around to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-capture/">grab these ideas</a> when they come. And they <em>will</em> hit you at inopportune times. Think about how you’ll capture ideas when you’re driving your car or taking a shower. If you don’t have a plan, you’ll start losing them.</p>

<h2 id="building-trust">Building Trust</h2>

<p>The only way you’ll build trust in your new list is to read through it regularly. I’ve found weekly to be a great starting point. It doesn’t matter when, so long as you do it. Schedule a time if you have to, but make sure you don’t forget this step; it is the most vital part of the process.</p>

<p>With consistent review, you begin to trust that your ideas aren’t lost after you write them down. You will come back to them. And as a nice bonus, you’ll start to have more ideas as you go through the list. Seeing them all together typically prompts new ones to form.</p>

<h2 id="making-decisions">Making Decisions</h2>

<p>If you create this list, collect ideas for it, and trust it, it’s still worthless if you never activate an idea. But when do you start working on an idea and how do you know which one to pick?</p>

<p>Timing is the easy part. You can only choose to work on an idea if you have time (or make time) for it. If you decide to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">get up early</a> to work on that new side project, you know when you’ll work on it. If you feel overwhelmed by your workload as it is, you need to focus on completing current projects before you take on a new one.</p>

<p>Deciding which idea to pursue is the hard part. If possible, you want the idea to have purpose and hold your interest. If there’s no strategic or direct value in it, why work on it? It should either be a building block to something else or a straightforward product that you’ll enjoy.</p>

<p>When you find yourself having a lot of new ideas, take advantage of it. Write them down, because they don’t always come when you want them.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Generating-Creative-Energy.jpg" /><p>I had never thought of myself as a creative person until recently. Math and science have always been my strengths, so the arty side never took center stage.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Then I started this blog. People say that one benefit of writing is a better understanding of your own thoughts. It’s true. I’ve learned a lot about myself since starting to blog, and it’s one of the primary reasons I recommend blogging to others.</p>

<p>But writing on a schedule or regularly creating anything requires a lot of new ideas. When you start, you may have a backlog of these that you’ve been thinking about. But at some point you’ll need more. How do you plan to generate them?</p>

<p>Do a quick search for “releasing creative energy” and you’ll find a lot of articles on how to develop more ideas - going on a walk, meditating, getting outside, drinking coffee, people watching, and so on.</p>

<p>These are great tips to help clear your mind and allow you to find and connect new dots. But I’ve found that there’s more to it than <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/13/">letting my mind wander</a>. Sometimes I need to take action to kick off creativity flow.</p>

<h2 id="check-things-off">Check Things Off</h2>

<p>Think about the most recent big project you completed. What did you do after it was checked off? Celebrate? Take a week off? Lie low for a while?</p>

<p>And how did you feel when it was done? After a big push like I did for <em><a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">Working with OmniFocus</a></em>, I felt a huge weight lift and I started wondering what would come next. I had been working so hard for so long that not having that big project in front of me gave me a sense of freedom and excitement. It released my mind to go on to the next thing, which kicked off creative flow.</p>

<h2 id="analog-brainstorming">Analog Brainstorming</h2>

<p>There’s something about leaving ink on a piece of paper that helps my mind process thoughts more clearly. The process of analog writing is so natural that I can move from one idea to the other with very little friction. Even hitting a keyboard shortcut to add a node to a mindmap can create enough resistance to slow my wandering brain and interfere with the next idea. I have two things to think about - the idea itself and the process of entering that idea. (Talk about high maintenance.)</p>

<p>Between paper and whiteboards, I’m free to roam from one topic or crazy idea to another with zero resistance to connecting the next dot. Writing by hand is natural; when I need an idea for something, I go analog and let my mind meander.</p>

<p>Note: a timer is helpful here. It can eliminate the worry of spending too much time daydreaming.</p>

<h2 id="talk-about-it">Talk About It</h2>

<p>I often forget this step or don’t want to do it, but telling friends about your ideas can spark more ideas. A different perspective on a topic can lead to more connections, developing your idea into something more complete.</p>

<p>I don’t like to do this. What if someone steals my idea? I don’t want something I’ve come up with being taken from me. But I’ve found that rarely happens. If I stick to my trusted circle of mentors and friendships, it’s not an issue.</p>

<h2 id="collect">Collect</h2>

<p>The more inputs and experiences you can bring into your mind, the more points you have to connect. This is partly why going for a walk, getting outside, and watching people can drive new ideas. These experiences provoke your mind to roam and give you new information to connect to your previous ideas and thoughts.</p>

<p>The more information you can collect about your topic and the more experiences you have, the more ingredients you have to formulate and expand your idea.</p>

<p>My goal in all of these scenarios is to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">free my mind</a> to have ideas. If I’m able to think clearly without worry, I can create more freely.</p>
