        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Breaking-the-Cycle.jpg" /><p>It’s time for a confession: I’m addicted to my phone. I want to check Twitter every five minutes and find myself refreshing Feedly every ten. And I hate it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve developed a habit of always wondering if there is something that needs my response. If someone asks me a question on Twitter, I want to get back to them right away. I don’t want them waiting on me. I don’t like being the one that holds up the line.</p>

<h2 id="steps-to-building-a-habit">Steps to building a habit</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of research behind building habits, but it doesn’t have to apply only to good habits. Understanding this cycle can help break bad habits as well. Break one of the steps and the habit stops.</p>

<h3 id="trigger">1. Trigger</h3>

<p>I love helping. Finding ways to solve problems for others will motivate me to work all day, every day. The downside is that I will sometimes go looking for problems that need to be solved. I primarily look for these problems in my own systems and tools, so the trigger is simply wondering if someone found an issue or has a question.</p>

<h3 id="reaction">2. Reaction</h3>

<p>My reaction to this trigger is to solve the problem or look for a problem. Whenever I wonder if there is a problem that needs solved or I think that a question might have popped up, I check the various places where a problem or question could arise. In my case, that’s mostly Twitter, Reddit, or email.</p>

<h3 id="treat">3. Treat</h3>

<p>Much like our dog gets treats when he does a trick, I get a treat when I solve a problem or answer a question. People tend to say thank you or show appreciation when you help out and that small incentive makes me want to keep helping. The trigger has been set off again.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-the-cycle">Breaking the cycle</h2>

<p>Scientists in agriculture have become really good at breaking the life cycle of insects. Whether it’s interrupting their mating season, creating a bad environment for eggs, or not allowing one of the metamorphosis steps, they can find ways to keep the pests from propagating and damaging crops.</p>

<p>It’s this cycle interruption that I’m attempting to put in place. Just telling myself not to  wonder will not likely happen. The thought enters faster than I can stop it, so I need to stop my reaction to the trigger - looking at social media and email. My primary means of checking is my phone and the best way to keep me off my phone is to leave it out of my reach. I’m much too lazy to get up just to check Twitter.</p>

<p>While I’m at work I can keep my phone across the room since I don’t usually check things on my Mac. I can leave it in my office when I go upstairs for lunch. After work, I have designated a place for it to land. If it’s not in my pocket, I’m less likely to get it and check things.</p>

<p>My hope is that by breaking this cycle, I’ll be more present with my family and break the habit. I know that my attention has fallen away from them when they need it. I’m not okay with that.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Reviews-and-Scripting-Learn-OmniFocus-Webinar.jpg" /><p>A great asset behind OmniFocus is the community of people willing to share and ask questions; and one place to enjoy the resources this community creates is at <a href="http://learnomnifocus.com/?ref=11">Learn OmniFocus</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Tim Stringer, founder of Learn OmniFocus, recently invited me to do a live webinar about my OmniFocus setup on the site and add to this growing repository of content. I was thrilled and  honored to share.</p>

<p>In the recording below you’ll see normal stuff like setting up projects and contexts, but I also emphasize the importance of doing regular reviews and share a script I’ve written to help. I like doing reviews on set days, so I needed to be able to move the Next Review Date of a project to match my scheduled review date. If you’re interested in this script or some of the others I mention in the webinar, you can <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">find them on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">Working with Omnifocus</a>, this is one of the most complete overviews of my entire system. Tim Stringer has generously given me the feed to share with you, so check it out.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve been working long hours for the last couple months to make <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a> happen. There were late nights, early mornings, and long afternoons. Blood, sweat, tears, sickness and exhaustion all came into play at some point. And I’ve been thrilled at the response.</p>

<p>Many of you have sent me emails and joined the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/joebuhlig/comments/3rhedi/working_with_omnifocus/">Reddit discussion</a> to let me know what you think of the book. I have received emails from folks who have changed their perspective on how they work and look for better ways to manage their tasks. They are heartfelt and grateful. They drive me to do more and help anywhere I can. It’s these people that keep me excited about the work I do.</p>

<p>And I will continue to look for ways to do that, but not right now. After the hard work that’s gone into this and the unending support that my family has given me over the past months, it’s time to take a short break and give to them. I’ll be back at it next week, but I’m taking a long weekend to recoup.  Thank you for all the great feedback, it’s been a wild ride.</p>

<p>It’s been down to the wire, but it’s finally here - <em>Working with OmniFocus</em>. A book that takes you through my entire system. It’s not for someone looking for a how-to manual for OmniFocus, but for those looking to understand the deeper concepts and nuances of the tool.</p>

<p>I’m super excited that it’s finally here! I’ve spent most of my editing time trying to make sure that it’s packed full of details and examples. The more real I can be with you, the better you can understand how it works.</p>

<p>If you’ve read the book and want to share it with others, why not make money while you’re at it? You can <a href="http://tools.joebuhlig.com/affiliates/">sign up</a> to be an affiliate and get paid when others make a purchase using your link.</p>

<p>I made a consolidated place for us to chat about the book. Most of the time that discussion is more helpful in public. And the quickest, easiest way I know to do that is with Reddit. I have a Subreddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/joebuhlig/">/r/joebuhlig</a>) where I’ve posted the link to the book. Let’s discuss it there - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/joebuhlig/comments/3rhedi/working_with_omnifocus/">Reddit Discussion</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Favorite-Workflows.jpg" /><p>I’ve received a number of requests for more detail around my use of <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow</a> (<a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">iTunes</a>). I’ve said that it saves time, but here are some details.
<!--more--></p>

<p>If I find myself doing something repeatedly, I look for a way to automate it. Since AppleScripting isn’t possible on iOS, I turn to Workflow for some of the same functionality. Here are my heavy hitter workflows.</p>

<h2 id="headed-home">Headed Home</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/efa5488ee8e44687ad75e628a5ba1b1d">Headed Home Workflow</a></p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Workflow_Headed-Home.png" /></p>

<p>There a quite a few instances each week when I’m out of the house without a specific time that I’m expected to return. My wife often needs to know when I’m headed home so she can plan accordingly. In those cases, I use this workflow to let her know I’m on my way and how long it should be before I get there. This workflow is one of three that I keep in the Today View for easy access because I use it so frequently.</p>

<h2 id="copy-base-url">Copy Base URL</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/1de51ad711624c1daace1159e2abab4e">Copy Base URL Workflow</a></p>

<p>This is a rare case when I introduce more steps to a process in order to get a cleaner result. Many times I need to copy a URL but I really don’t like having extra querystring parameters at the end of the URL. I use this to expand shortened URLS and strip the extra nonsense off the end. Then it’s added to my clipboard.</p>

<h2 id="save-to-dropbox">Save to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/db653ceda86942328b802cce58f6b6ed">Save to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>Any time I run across a file (typically a PDF) on my phone that I want to save to DropBox, I use this. I could do the “Open in…” thing, but I know where I want it to go in DropBox before I even start - my DropBox inbox. This workflow takes the file and drops it into my inbox. It’s faster than everything else I’ve tried.</p>

<h2 id="share-title--twitter">Share Title &amp; Twitter</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/44904f69761047ae8fb3d8a741ff08d6">Share Title &amp; Twitter Workflow</a></p>

<p>I have another <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/workflow-to-share-articles-with-twitter-handle/">one similar to this</a> that shares an article with a Twitter handle and asks for a comment about the article. If I don’t have a specific thought about an article but still want to share it, I use this instead. It puts the title of the article in quotes, adds a link to the article, and searches the page for a Twitter handle to include at the end of the tweet.</p>

<h2 id="instatweet">InstaTweet</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/7702a22e5dfe426da5a60f59d519ba10">InstaTweet Workflow</a></p>

<p>When I want to share a photo on Instagram and Twitter I know I can select Twitter from Instagram, but I prefer to embed them directly. This workflow allows me to select the photo, add a caption, and send it both places at once.</p>

<h2 id="article-to-pdf">Article to PDF</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/2ec2ca89dbad4c4db754788f6fccae9d">Article to PDF Workflow</a></p>

<p>This is a small piece of my research storage mechanism. To save an article  for a project I’m working on, I run this workflow which saves it as a PDF in my DropBox inbox. These are processed during my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a> and are often moved to project folders.</p>

<h2 id="take-pic-to-dropbox">Take Pic to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/c348878f30b24163afc1d4cbdce15b87">Take Pic to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>This is similar to the Article to PDF workflow, but it opens the camera. I take a picture and it is immediately sent to my DropBox inbox. This is really handy if I want to save a picture of a restaurant menu or a bag of coffee. When I process these, I move them to their respective locations in my file structure for reference.</p>

<h2 id="send-pic-to-dropbox">Send Pic to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/ec13b1062c5d47a1813a348ed659c27c">Send Pic to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>Just like the previous workflow, this adds a picture to my DropBox inbox but allows me to select pictures from my photo library. There are times when I remember taking a picture that I want to use for a project. This helps me get them into DropBox quickly and easily.</p>

<h2 id="screenshot-to-dropbox">Screenshot to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/43d066eb6d194620b1ed4f9134d96810">Screenshot to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>I’m building a lot of websites lately and part of my process involves looking for web design inspiration. This means I’m taking a lot of screenshots of other websites. I keep this workflow in my Today View so I can take the screenshot, swipe down, and send it to DropBox right away.</p>

And we’re all looking for ways to get better, faster, and create higher quality products. That’s pretty obvious when you read our articles.

<p>But if you were able to see my side of the screen you would see my daily fight to be productive. I want to waste a day on YouTube every day. I could do that. I would hate myself for it, but I want to do it anyway. It’s a struggle that I think we all fight at some level.</p>

<p>I review my weekly goals every morning. That’s what matters to me. I want to get my work done so I can spend more time with my family. And I want to spend time on projects that I find important. That single step is easily the most vital component to a productive day for me.</p>

<p>I can do that routine day after day and I <em>will</em> do it day after day. It’s the only way I have a chance of accomplishing anything. And if I’m honest and open with you, I would admit that there are many days I fail.</p>

<p>I have days when I’m doing good to get through my email. I have no idea why, but I  really don’t want to do anything that’s on my lists. I have deadlines coming but I’m doing research for a project that I won’t even consider starting for another year. I’m great at procrastiworking.</p>

<h1 id="but-stop">But stop</h1>

<p>Here’s the thing. We can all find ways to do work in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/lost-in-transition/">transitional times</a> and maximize every minute of every day in our calendars. But, I’m tired. I just want to blow some time on Twitter. Is that okay?</p>

<p><em>I think that’s perfectly fine</em>. I do it. I don’t recommend doing it a lot and I try to limit the amount of time I blow, but I think it’s important to stop being productive once in a while. Or maybe it’s best to stop being productive multiple times a week or day. It just depends on what you’ve been doing, how tired you are, and how much you have coming up.</p>

<p>I’ve been working really long hours trying to get <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus/">my book</a> finished. It’s tiring and at the end of each day I struggle to think straight. When the girls go down for bed I blow a little time reading articles or cruising Twitter-land. I’m unable to do any work at that time. I don’t even want to look at my lists. I just need to stop.</p>

<h1 id="and-do-what">And do what?</h1>

<p>When you stop, don’t always blow it on YouTube. The number one way I stop is by playing with my girls. They need me more than I need to catch up on Instagram. I try to stop for a while after work every day. I don’t check my lists and I do my best to set my phone down. I’ve been on the computer all day and I have a cycle of catching up on inboxes every 30 minutes or so. When I’ve done that all day my brain expects me to continue feeding it with new things whether I’m working or not. It doesn’t care that I need a break.</p>

<p>But I do care. I don’t want to continue feeding that addiction. It’s hard, but sometimes it’s best to just stop being productive.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/From-Wordpress-Google-to-Jekyll-Piwik.jpg" /><p>This website has run on WordPress and Google Analytics from day one and they’ve both treated me pretty well. But I’ve started to see a need for more flexibility in the site, so it’s time for a big change.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This is mostly a back-end change that shouldn’t affect the UI much. There are a few small UI changes I’m making, but that’s to make the site cleaner. The more I’ve gotten into web development and design the pickier I’ve become with my site. Ultimately, I’m looking for a simplified user experience for you and more respect for your privacy.</p>

<h2 id="why-wordpress-and-google">Why WordPress and Google?</h2>

<p>For about a year and a half I ran the site on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> through <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost</a> with Google Analytics.  It was easy and quick for me at the time. WordPress has a good, long track record so I fell in line to get my site up quickly. I didn’t want to worry about technicalities - I needed to spend my time creating.</p>

<p>The standard for analytics has been Google Analytics for some time. Google has a reputation for having some of the best if not <em>the</em> best reports and tracking for your website. When I started I knew very little about tracking. I was just looking for a way to see what kind of traffic I was getting and almost everyone recommended GA. Sometimes I’m okay with taking the easy road if it means shipping something quickly. I can evaluate the nuances later. And I can always do the research and migration process after the launch if I need to - which is what I’ve done here.</p>

<h2 id="why-jekyll">Why Jekyll?</h2>

<p>As a replacement for WordPress, I’ve decided to create a static site using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I ran across Jekyll through blog posts from <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a>. I then spent a couple of hours researching and reviewing websites built with Jekyll. I was blown away by the load speeds involved.</p>

<p>I started looking at some of the numbers on my site and found that the average page was loading in about eight seconds. All of the tests I was doing on my machine came in around four seconds, but that didn’t take into account the various devices that people use. That extra four seconds meant my site was way too slow. <em>Eight seconds?</em> Sites built with Jekyll are typically loading in less than one second.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to get into Ruby and Rails lately. Since Jekyll is built on Ruby and I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/7/">learn by using a language</a>, it made for a good project. Jekyll seems to be one of the most common static site generators as well. There’s a lot of support and plugins for it already, so I felt comfortable joining that community.</p>

<p>Moving to a static site allows me the flexibility to build one-off pages and posts in a highly customized way. Since I’m becoming more particular about how things look and how you interact with them, it only makes sense. Jekyll seems to fit the bill quite well.</p>

<h2 id="why-piwik">Why Piwik?</h2>

<p>I want to step away from the data collection that Google does on you. I don’t want to share your data against your will and I don’t want to put you into their system simply because you wanted to read my articles. I understand that you might be okay with this, but I’m learning that I’m not necessarily okay with this myself. There’s a big backlash against ads and tracking right now and although I’m not wanting to jump on that bandwagon, it is something that I’ve been thinking a lot about lately.</p>

<p>And although tracking and ads are okay in some scenarios, I’ve found that I’m uneasy about the tracking that goes alongside Google Analytics. That might be unwarranted and unfounded, but I don’t want to leave it when it makes me uncomfortable. A great example of this is <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a> and his ad-blocking iOS app. He had a great app and it worked well, but it <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good">didn’t feel right</a> for him. So he pulled it and Apple issued refunds. Google Analytics on this website falls in the same category for me. It might be okay, but I’m not comfortable with it.</p>

<p>I still have a need to understand the analytics for my site so I started looking for alternatives and ran across <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>. It allows me to collect the numbers that I’m looking for, but the data stays local. There is no master server that the numbers go back to. Your data never leaves the site. I have a database (that only I have access to) that stores the information and it sits on the same server that this website sits on. The data is anonymous and never goes anywhere. It allows me to get those numbers and not sacrifice your privacy in the process. I think that’s a great trade-off.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting?</h2>

<p>In the process of making the shift to a static site, I’m also launching a <a href="http://tools.joebuhlig.com/">new sub-domain</a> that will be running on Rails. I was previously running my hosting through Bluehost, but while setting up a Rails application, I found that Bluehost is not very easy to use for anything other than one-click installations. So I’m also moving my host over to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=b0f9f06b6067">affiliate</a>).</p>

<h2 id="when">When?</h2>

<p>Today. I spent the last few weeks working on the static site. There are still some bugs I’m working out, but for the most part it’s all here. Let me know what you think!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Using-Drafts.jpg" /><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id905337691?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Drafts</a> is one of those apps that I cannot go without. The funny thing is that my tech-resistant wife is now dependent on it as well. And you can be sure that I am pretty excited about <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/5/">her use of it</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Drafts can be intimidating if you’re not used to dreaming up ways to connect apps on your phone. So it’s helpful to use other people’s ideas as a baseline for building your own methods. Here are a some of my favorite ways to use Drafts:</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus-with-note">OmniFocus with note</h2>

<p><a href="x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%20%200.451%2C%0A%20%200.29%2C%0A%20%200.553%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=1&amp;uuid=BDE52DB2-95AF-4AD4-8734-17068C3E8C9F&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22urlTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22omnifocus%3A%5C%2F%5C%2F%5C%2Fadd%3Fname%3D%7B%7B%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%7D%7D%26note%3D%7B%7B%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D%7D%7D%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22encodeTags%22%20%3A%20false%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22URL%22%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=First%20line%20saves%20to%20the%20title%20of%20a%20OmniFocus%20task%2C%20while%20the%20rest%20of%20the%20Draft%20is%20added%20to%20Notes%20section.%20The%20original%20draft%20is%20then%20archived%20automatically.%20&amp;modifiedAt=2015-07-20%2012%3A13%3A49%20%2B0000&amp;name=OmniFocus%20with%20Note&amp;iconImageName=action_clipboard">Install OmniFocus with Note Drafts Action</a></p>

<p>My primary use of Drafts is to capture tasks that will end up in OmniFocus. It’s not uncommon to see the Drafts badge at six or higher. Those are typically tasks that will be moved to OmniFocus but I needed to capture them quickly.</p>

<h2 id="save-url-as-pdf-in-dropbox">Save URL as PDF in DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=1&amp;uuid=D65D2C58-A84A-4517-8015-1BE97D43C6B5&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22writeType%22%20%3A%20%22create%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22fileTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22Dropbox%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22folderTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22%5C%2FArticle_Import%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22fileExtTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22txt%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22fileNameTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%22%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=&amp;modifiedAt=2015-09-28%2012%3A02%3A35%20%2B0000&amp;name=Save%20URL%20as%20PDF&amp;iconImageName=action_dropbox">Install Save URL as PDF Drafts Action</a></p>

<p>When I run across an article I’m interested in but I’m not sure what I want to do with it I’ll dump it into Drafts. When I’m emptying my Drafts inbox during my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a> and run across one of these that I want to save as research, I use this action. It creates a text file in DropBox with the title of the article as the title of the file and puts the URL in the body of the file. My Mac will then turn that text file into a PDF that I can use for later.</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus-list">OmniFocus list</h2>

<p><a href="x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%20%200.451%2C%0A%20%200.29%2C%0A%20%200.553%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=1&amp;uuid=9B95D317-17CC-4336-809D-2410C52B7AF2&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22listName%22%20%3A%20%22Omnifocus%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22noteDelimiter%22%20%3A%20%22%7C%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22List%20in%20Reminders%22%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=&amp;modifiedAt=2015-09-28%2015%3A57%3A57%20%2B0000&amp;name=OmniFocus&amp;iconImageName=action_reminder">Install OmniFocus List Drafts Action</a></p>

<p>Close behind the <em>OmniFocus with Note</em> action is the <em>OmniFocus List</em> action. It works pretty much the same way as the first except I can brain-dump a list of items all at once. Each line in the draft will become a new task in OmniFocus.</p>

<h2 id="today-extension">Today extension</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Drafts_Today_Clip.png" /></p>

<p>If I run across a quote that I want to embed in a blog post or share with someone, I can copy it and send it Drafts with the “+clip” action in the Today View. It lands in my Drafts inbox for triage later, but sometimes I go and action it right then.</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus-action-key">OmniFocus action key</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/OmniFocus_Keyboard_Action.png" /></p>

<p>If I want to be really quick and send ideas to OmniFocus immediately, I can invoke the action key. It sits right on top of the keyboard so as soon as I’m done typing I can hit that to send it to OmniFocus immediately and start typing the next task without any delay. This one feature has me using Drafts for brainstorming sessions.</p>

<h2 id="siri-to-drafts">Siri to Drafts</h2>

<p>I have my default reminders list set to a list called “Drafts.” Drafts is set up to pull items from this list into my Drafts inbox. This allows me to ask Siri to remind me of something and it will automatically end up in my Drafts inbox.</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus-somedaymaybes">OmniFocus Someday/Maybes</h2>

<p>I’ve written about these in the past but I have a dedicated list of actions that take drafts and dump them into Someday/Maybe lists in OmniFocus without the need for any triage in my OmniFocus inbox. You can see how I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-omnifocus-for-somedaymaybe-lists/">set up the actions here</a> and how I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-auto-parser/">automatically parse them here</a>.</p>

<p>And because I’m proud of her getting into digital capture methods, here’s the one my wife uses all the time:</p>

<h2 id="email-yourself-a-task">Email yourself a task</h2>

<p><a href="x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%20%200.031%2C%0A%20%200.455%2C%0A%20%200.627%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=2&amp;uuid=EA743F3F-8612-4615-88E4-6DAF1E0B344D&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22sendInBackground%22%20%3A%20true%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22bccRecipientString%22%20%3A%20%22%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22toRecipientString%22%20%3A%20%22example%40example.com%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22subject%22%20%3A%20%22%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22replyTo%22%20%3A%20%22%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22sendAsHTML%22%20%3A%20false%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22sendInBackgroundPrefix%22%20%3A%20%22%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22body%22%20%3A%20%22%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22Email%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22ccRecipientString%22%20%3A%20%22%22%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=Open%20Mail.app%20email%20window%20with%20first%20line%20of%20draft%20as%20subject%2C%20and%20the%20remainder%20of%20the%20draft%20as%20the%20body.&amp;modifiedAt=2015-10-08%2015%3A06%3A19%20%2B0000&amp;name=Email%20To%20Do&amp;iconImageName=action_email_filled">Install Email Yourself Drafts Action</a></p>

<p>Becky knows that having items sitting in her email inbox drives her crazy. She doesn’t like seeing new emails that she needs to act on. And she knows that if she emails a task to herself she will move it out of her inbox and into her paper system as soon as possible. Her email inbox is the one digital place that she checks regularly. So it’s nice for her to be able to email tasks to herself since she knows she’ll act on them. She uses drafts with an action key above her keyboard to type the task and immediately send it to her email. This would drive me insane, but it has been very helpful for her.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I use Drafts to get things out of my head. Anytime I see something online or I have an idea, I add it to Drafts first. Sometimes I can make the decision about what I want to do with it right then and will action it off immediately. But most of time I find myself leaving it in Drafts until my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a>. Drafts is my primary tool for keeping my head clear and my mind focused.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/How-I-Started-with-Technology.jpg" /><p>When I was 16 I bought my own Compaq laptop. Remember those? I had been using the family computer quite a bit, but this was my own computer. That was the beginning of my journey with technology.</p>

<h2 id="sound-and-slides">Sound and slides</h2>

<p>I claimed it would be for school work. That was my crap-rationalization. But if I’m honest with myself it had more to do with exploring without consequences. I didn’t want to screw up the family computer by running a bunch of batch files just to see what they would do. I would rather create a mess for myself on my own computer. That, and it was a lot of fun to say I own my own computer when I went to school.</p>

<p>Around the same time I started running sound and slides on Sunday morning at our church. If they wanted help with a special event when the sound system or a computer was involved, I nearly always said yes. I was drawn to it, fascinated by problem-solving with a bunch of cords and components working together.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-mac">My first Mac</h2>

<p>I bought my first Mac while at college. It was different and it seemed as though people who were building software and websites were using Macs. My thinking was purely, “That looks cool. I wanna try.” I don’t recommend making purchases of this size because something looks cool. But it was college, and I know there’s an unwritten requirement somewhere that says you should do something dumb in college.</p>

<p>The MacBook was my first jump into productivity, but I didn’t realize it. The Mac made it a lot easier for me to track events and notes. I always had a side-job in college and I needed help keeping track of my schedule. Looking back on it, I didn’t have a busy schedule. I just wanted to play with the apps. I guess my mind and digital tendencies naturally drew me to the building of systems that come with productivity.</p>

<h2 id="gis">GIS</h2>

<p>Also in college I did a couple of internships that had me working with GIS and handheld computers. They were set up to collect data on soil samples and crop scouting for corn and soybean fields, (yes, if you didn’t know, I’m a farm kid. No matter what I do or where I go, I’m always drawn to farmers and growing food. And tractors).</p>

<p>The fun part of those internships was finding ways of using handheld computers to make the process easier. I even began dictating notes into those devices. They were very crude at the time and I spent a lot of time cleaning up the notes I entered, but it was still a system that worked for me. It also taught me a lot about mapping and how to collect and report spatial data on crops.</p>

<h2 id="excel">Excel</h2>

<p>During my senior year of college I worked as a teaching assistant in a farm management class and began teaching other students how to use Excel. I was very basic in my use of Excel at the time, but I was more advanced than most of the students and professors. It was my first jump into teaching others how to use software. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it. I’ve learned that my mind just works the same way computers do, which makes it very easy to catch on to a computer system and then translate it for others.</p>

<h2 id="databases-vba--sql">Databases, VBA, &amp; SQL</h2>

<p>When I graduated from college I went into soybean breeding and quickly learned that seed research works with a lot of data. And I also learned how to dissect tiny soybean flowers. My use of Excel grew exponentially and I found myself starting create basic programs through VBA and macros. It was a progression and eventually led me to using bar-code scanners and Excel macros to collect and verify data.</p>

<p>My experience in soybean breeding and the databases involved led me to a corporate position where I analyzed large amounts of data on a SQL Server. It was a very nerdy job and I didn’t really know what I was doing when I started. But I knew that I could learn just about anything computer-related pretty quickly, so I jumped in.</p>

<p>There was a lot of data to work with in that role. There were so many ways I <em>could</em> analyze the data that I often got lost trying to figure out what to work on. That’s when the productivity monster caught me and I started down the path of GTD.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-productivity-and-design">Corporate, productivity, and design</h2>

<p>In the corporate environment I had a big influx of information and creative work that I needed to do. Yes, I had a very analytical role but there’s a large amount of creativity that is needed to design and develop interfaces and structures around data. It was essentially the beginnings of web development for me because I wanted to show the data in an easy to understand way. I can’t stand looking at the same bar charts every day and wondering if the data has been altered to show a biased view of the information. I wanted them to be clean and accurate. That’s when my supervisor introduced me to <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a> and I began to delve into the data design world.</p>

<p>In that process I learned I have a strong creative side. I explored that more fully when I took a position with a marketing company. I started to develop more extensive web reports and began building an internal web application. That’s when I started to look beyond what I knew how to do and started building out new ideas and finding alternative ways to do things. In other words I finally let my brain loose and started learning how to pair my creative mind with the analytical.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>If you listen to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/whaddyaknowjoe/">my podcast</a> you heard me mention that I recently left my job and I’m now beginning to develop apps and web applications for myself and others. I’m now running with my own ideas and building them. I never thought I would be at this point, but it’s been an exciting journey.</p>

<p>Since starting on my own, I’ve been exploring new computer languages and building some of the bigger ideas that I never had time to tackle before. There’s some start-up time involved, but along this journey I have found systems and disciplines that help me stay motivated to focus on the work that I’m doing. Figuring out what technology to build next is exciting, and I’m having a blast.</p>
