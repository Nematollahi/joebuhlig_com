        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/The-Importance-of-Data-Visualization.jpg" /><p>It’s easy to present data in a summarized table, but what about turning it into a data visualization?
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>Data visualization is the display of data in a picture. Its purpose is to give a clear and easily understood visual of what the data is saying. Understanding the story in a data set by looking at spreadsheets and raw data isn’t something most people are accustomed to or good at, so we rely on a visualized format of the data, typically a graph or chart,  to help us.</p>

<h2 id="false-perceptions">False Perceptions</h2>

<p>It is critical to do this well or we risk giving the viewer an <a href="http://data.heapanalytics.com/how-to-lie-with-data-visualization/">incorrect perception</a> of the story behind the data. The display should show what is going on behind the scenes and the focus should be the data, not your interpretation of the data. Following conventional graphing methods will make it easier for your viewer to understand it. If you ignore these conventions, you risk building a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/bad-bar-charts/">bad bar chart</a> and deceiving your audience. You can get away with this if you do it subtly, but you’re sacrificing your integrity in the process and it will eventually come around to bite you.</p>

<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>

<p>When the visualization is done right, it explains what is happening. It’s impossible to look through millions of data points and know how things turned out. We can do summaries of the data to help, but oftentimes the summaries are even too complicated. People are visual by nature so a picture helps us see what is going on and interpret the results more clearly.</p>

<h2 id="patterns-and-outliers">Patterns and Outliers</h2>

<p>When you take the time to pull together this picture, you might be surprised at the patterns that start to reveal themselves. There are times when you may not realize you have patterns in your data until you put it in picture form. There are also times when the visual helps you see something that stands out. Just like the unknown patterns, you may not be aware of an outstanding data point until you graph it.</p>

<p>Take the time to build a good display of data. You want it to tell an accurate story and paint a picture of what is really going on. And it may show you something you didn’t know before.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Time-and-dollars.jpg" /><p>When I started my business, I wasn’t in a place to say no to anything. I needed to provide an income, and every little bit helped. But recently I’ve had to start deciding which activities are most worth my time and which ones need to be put aside.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This isn’t a decision I can make by sitting in front of a fire drinking coffee. As much as I like coffee, it’s not <em>that</em> good. I need some numbers to reveal the biggest (and smallest) returns on my time. I started <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro/">tracking my time</a>, but I need to dig deeper than that.</p>

<h2 id="budget">Budget</h2>

<p>Every good business has a budget. And mine, H&amp;A Tech, is no different. Without it, I don’t know if I’m making money or losing money. This simple document has a line for income and separate lines for each type of expense I incur. At the beginning of each month I plan the expenses and expected income for the month, and I do what I can to stick to it. Any deviation can create issues for my family later.</p>

<p>This is pretty standard, but it deviates from the norm when I pull in transactional data. I have a second tab that accepts copy-pasted transactions from my bank. Once a month I pull in this data and then augment each line item with a client and activity. It sounds tedious, but with the help of a few filters similar transactions can be filled in simultaneously.</p>

<p>Because I’m correlating the transactional data with the budget categories, I can see a clear summary of each month. How well did I stick to the plan?</p>

<p>Then I have savings. With an online business comes subscriptions and those often have annual payments. I handle those with a savings tab in the spreadsheet, but that’s a topic for another day.</p>

<h2 id="google-sheet">Google Sheet</h2>

<p>This might be a bit hard to get your head around so I put together an example budget for you to look through. I keep my budget in a Google Sheet so I made a copy and cleared it out for you to see. Here are the tabs you’ll find in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kDUSdsIKvtUnXxd4z9hgBQMUiht1oq_p6Iixl6dTyCU">the example</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Budget - the plan for the month (includes the summary)</li>
  <li>Transactions - the bank transactional data</li>
  <li>Savings - long term expenses and savings funds</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="from-budget-to-time-tracker">From Budget to Time Tracker</h2>

<p>The budget is in place and the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro/">time tracker</a> is tracking away. So I created a new tab in the time tracker to import the transactional data from the budget. With the data pulled over, I group the time and transactions by month, client, and activity using pivot tables. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Time and Dollars/time-aggregation.jpg" /></p>

<p>With the datasets each grouped in the same way, they can now be tied together into a single table. I do this with the SUMPRODUCT function as <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2012/04/26/using-multiple-criteria-in-excel-lookup-formulas/">explained here</a> which makes it a one-step process. Once the data is all in one place, I can run another pivot table to figure out where my time is most valuable.</p>

<h2 id="by-client">By Client</h2>

<p>Is my time better spent on my own projects or working for my clients? And the follow-up question: which clients give me the best return on my time? If I have a client that requires a lot of support and effort but there isn’t much for income to compensate, I either need to raise my rates or consider letting them go. It’s difficult to know about these situations without data. Once I have the information, I can make my decision with confidence.</p>

<h2 id="by-activity">By Activity</h2>

<p>The other segmentation I need to understand is the activity breakdown. What type of work has the highest monetary value? I ask this because I’m not sure if my return is higher when I write for myself or when I consult a client. By switching the pivot table to group by activity, I can see which types of work give me the highest returns and which ones I should consider scaling back.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Setting this up can be labor-intensive, but I hope you see the value here. Working for yourself can bring a lot of opportunities your way, and knowing which ones to take on and which to pass by can be tricky. This process gives you real numbers to work with and makes it less of a guessing game.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro.jpg" /><p>Lately I’ve been tracking my time and starting to correlate it with dollars earned. The idea is to help me decide which types of work are the most valuable. This is a look at how I’m doing the time tracking portion using <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="google-sheet">1. Google Sheet</h2>

<p>The data needs to live somewhere and I’m comfortable with Google Drive. So I created a new sheet with five columns:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>DateTime</strong> - Timestamp of when it was recorded.</li>
  <li><strong>Client</strong> - Who is the activity for? This is mostly “Joe Buhlig.”</li>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong> - Writing an article, recording a podcast, coding, etc…</li>
  <li><strong>Amount</strong> - How long was I doing the activity?</li>
  <li><strong>Notes</strong> - Any notes I have about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this format I can do roll-ups by client or by activity. It allows me to compare the time I spend on a client and the gross income from that client to determine my hourly rate. This makes it easy to know if my rates are where they should be.</p>

<p>It also helps me determine the types of work that are the highest paying. Doing a similar roll-up by activity will tell me if my time is better spent coding or consulting. But I have to be careful, because the answers can be a bit misleading. Writing articles for this site shows a zero for profit, but I know that writing is what brings people to my site. And in turn, that leads to sales elsewhere. So my conclusions are a judgment call, but it is helpful to have the data in front of me.</p>

<h2 id="ifttt">2. IFTTT</h2>

<p>To collect the data I’m using a single recipe in <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>. It adds a row to the Google Sheet each time the LCP action is triggered. By passing different parameters to the recipe, I alter the data that is entered into the spreadsheet.</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/375147-time-tracking" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_13" id="embed_recipe-375147"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/375147" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Time Tracking connects launch-center to google-drive" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<h2 id="launch-center-pro">3. Launch Center Pro</h2>

<p>In LCP, I set up a different action for each activity I want to record. Each action uses the same url scheme to send the data on to Google. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">launch://ifttt/trigger?name=&amp;value1=&amp;value2=&amp;value3=[prompt-num:Time in Mins]&amp;value4=[prompt:Notes]</code></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> parameter will always be the same: the Trigger Name in the IFTTT recipe. In this case, I’m passing my own name as <code class="highlighter-rouge">value1</code> because this particular action is for recording development work I do for myself. The last three values record the activity type, amount of time I spent on the task, and any notes I want to enter about it.</p>

<h2 id="in-practice">In Practice</h2>

<p>Whenever I start a new task, I start a stopwatch. When I finish the task or need to move on to something else, I stop the watch, open LCP, and select the action for the task I was working on. I enter the time and any notes about it and I’m done. This creates a new record in the Google Sheet that I can use for analytics later.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve chosen Discourse as the engine behind the scenes. You can sign up at <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">discussion.joebuhlig.com</a>. To start, it will be really basic. My hope is that it will evolve into a community that can help each other out with tech and productivity questions and tips. Here are the categories I’m kicking it off with.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>This replaces the subreddit that I’ve been using. Each post will have a dedicated topic with replies embedded at the bottom of the post. This makes it possible to continually add to posts and see responses to the most popular questions without going to a different site.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-omnifocus">Working with OmniFocus</h2>

<p>This is a dedicated category for <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">the book</a>. Any questions about it or ideas for the next version go here.</p>

<h2 id="off-topic">Off Topic</h2>

<p>The majority of this site is based on technology and productivity, but sometimes I’d like to discuss interesting articles and topics that don’t really apply. This is where I’ll post them.</p>

<h2 id="meta">Meta</h2>

<p>This is a discussion about the discussion itself as well as this blog. If you have topic ideas or suggestions for how to improve the site or discussion, I’d love to see them here.</p>

<p>I am excited about building a community where we can help each other learn and grow. Come <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">check it out</a>!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Just-a-Laptop.jpg" /><p>When I started my business I made the shift from three 27” monitors to just a laptop screen. That shift has taught me a few things about how I work.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="different-modes">Different Modes</h2>

<p>I have different mindsets and needs when I’m doing different types of work. I can listen to upbeat music and kick back on the couch when I’m cycling through email, but I need instrumental, low-key music and my desk when I’m coding. These two examples were the extremes that made me start to pay attention.</p>

<p>Noticing those subtle differences has brought some pretty big gains in productivity. I used to rarely leave my desk because the monitors made it possible to see so much at once. When I only have the laptop screen it forces me to focus and choose the best (or most comfortable) environment.</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>Forcing focus has paid big dividends in my writing. Because I don’t have the ability to see a whole bunch of things at once, I stick to the task in front of me. Since the time I’m most vulnerable to YouTube binges is when I sit down to write, this has paid off. I usually enjoy the process of writing but getting started is hard when there’s a Twitter feed staring at me from the corner.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>One area that has suffered is coding. It’s not uncommon for me to have three browsers open, multiple instances of Sublime Text, and multiple terminal windows running all at once. The ease of seeing a bunch of those at once is extremely helpful and allows me to work much more quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>This isn’t my forever setup, but it is good for me to appreciate the advantages and acknowledge the limitations of working from “just a laptop.”</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Dictating-vs-Typing.jpg" /><p>Dictation is becoming more and more commonplace, and as the software behind it continues to get better we’ll likely see it become a bigger part of our daily lives.
<!--more--></p>

<p>It takes some practice, but once you understand the mechanics, dictating can increase your time efficiency. From texting to getting the latest Chiefs scores, there are endless uses for the technology. I use Siri a fair amount and now that “Hey Siri” is wireless in the iPhone 6S, I’ve found my use cases increasing.</p>

<p>Because of Siri’s current accuracy, I decided to dictate the first draft of <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a>. I knew that I could get the ideas out of my mind much faster if I were able to simply speak them.</p>

<p>It was great. I plugged in my podcasting mic, turned on dictation, and went to town. I could draft an entire chapter in about 90 minutes. In 6 days I had finished the entire first draft. It felt awesome to be able to do so much in so little time.</p>

<p>When I reflected on that process I realized that I spent a lot of time trying to find the specific words I wanted instead of working to get the ideas out of my head. I was able to input the words so quickly that I had a hard time coming up with the words I wanted. This by itself really isn’t a big deal, but it meant that I needed to find a way to pre-process my thoughts ahead of time.  In the end I spent an hour writing or typing my notes for each chapter before I dictated them, so there wasn’t much for time savings.</p>

<p>Since the dictation wasn’t 100% perfect, I spent quite a bit of time deciphering my original intent when editing. Not only was I trying to improve the sentences and paragraphs, but the words themselves were so far off at times that I couldn’t figure out what I was talking about and ended up rewriting the whole thing anyway.</p>

<p>More practice would likely improve my dictation, but the slower pace of typing gives me time to process my thoughts more clearly and reduce editing later. It helps me gain clarity faster and spend more time refining the ideas than the process. I will continue to use dictation for smaller chunks, but in my case anything long-form is better suited to typing.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Mac-Navigation.jpg" /><p>Nerdy Mac users are known for customizing their machines. Between keyboard shortcuts, Spaces, and third-party apps, you can effectively set up a computer that is perfect for you and unusable by someone else.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But folks don’t typically think about how they move from one application to another. Mission Control or Spaces are the standard solutions. I’ve found that Spaces doesn’t work well because it forces me to pull my hands from the keyboard to the trackpad. And I can never find the app I want in Mission Control.</p>

<h2 id="hiding">Hiding</h2>

<p>I’ve developed a process of showing and hiding apps, making it possible to immediately switch to the app I want by hiding the one I was just using. I use the built in shortcut Command-H to hide an application from view. It doesn’t close the application, it just moves it to the background. I can get back to it in a couple ways, by using Spotlight or by clicking on the app icon in the dock.</p>

<h2 id="alfred">Alfred</h2>

<p>But I prefer to use my launcher of choice, <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, to bring it back. I can invoke Alfred, type the name of the application I want, and keep moving. To make it even faster, I set up a few shortcuts for commonly used programs so I can go directly to the app I want. For example, I can hit Control-Option-O to pull up OmniFocus. Control-Option-F will open Finder and Control-Option-T opens Sublime Text. They all start with Control-Option to make it easier to remember.</p>

<h2 id="in-practice">In Practice</h2>

<p>Anytime I need a different app, I either type the Alfred shortcut or type the name of the app into Alfred. When I’m done with it, I hide it or repeat the process to open the next one. Just remember to close them when you’re done or your computer will be as slow as a slug.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Dvorak-Transition.jpg" /><p>I’ve had an interest in the Dvorak keyboard layout for a couple years now. The concept makes sense to me and I’m finally doing something about it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>For those not familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a>, it’s a simplified keyboard layout that is designed to reduce finger motion and errors. And by association, many proponents claim faster typing speed as a result.</p>

<p>I’m very interested in the typing speed claims, but I’m also intrigued by the idea of preemptively combating RSI. I don’t have any major issues right now, but as someone who makes a living by typing I can’t afford long-term degradation.</p>

<p>When it’s all over, I would like to know if the switch was worth it. But measuring finger movements would be pretty difficult. It would require setting up cameras and running the video through a sensing algorithm to determine the distance my fingers travel while typing a lot of text. And since Dvorak is already built to reduce motion, I don’t see the point. I would be trying to prove it was correctly designed. So instead, I’ll be measuring my typing speed to get a comparison.</p>

<p>I’m a data junky and want to make sure I have good numbers. But this case is complicated. I use two different keyboards in two different locations for most of my typing. I use the built-in keyboard in my MacBook Pro (MBP) when I’m writing from the couch and an Apple Wireless Keyboard (AWK) when I’m at my desk. Those scenarios rarely deviate, so I’ll be testing each instance.</p>

<p>I needed a baseline, so I started with the QWERTY keyboard I’m used to and picked four texts from <a href="http://www.typingtest.com/">typingtest.com</a>. I ran two rounds of two minutes from each keyboard/location. I started on the couch with the MBP and did two rounds of two minutes and then moved to my desk for another two rounds.</p>

<p>However, I have one issue with this: timing. I’ve always felt that my speed tends to fluctuate from the morning to the afternoon. I did the initial testing in the morning so I did another round in the afternoon. And because I like be extra sure of things, I repeated the whole process two days in a row. All of this was done from the QWERTY keyboard before switching anything to Dvorak. No need tainting the waters.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see very little difference between the MBP and the AWK. Overall, my average QWERTY typing speed was 72 wpm. Not bad.</p>

<p>Once I had all of my numbers on QWERTY, I added a <a href="http://kbcovers.com/dvorak-keyboard-cover">keyboard cover</a> to my MBP and switched everything over to Dvorak. I made the switch cold turkey and won’t be trying to maintain QWERTY at the same time. And in the interest of good data, I repeated the entire process above on Dvorak.</p>

<p>I have a long way to go before I reach my initial QWERTY speed. My hope is that going all-in with Dvorak will help me get there quicker. It’s all for the sake of faster and more efficient typing.</p>

<p>This is the most basic form of counting I do: how many views did each article receive? The OmniFocus Setup article has always been my top article, but one of the newcomers is the Monthly Planning article. It made the top 10 in views for the year and it’s only been live for three weeks.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-omnifocus">Working with OmniFocus</h2>

<p>This is my favorite accomplishment of 2015. I had been wanting to write a book for a long time but never had the time. It seems that there were a lot of you interested in reading it as well. In two short months, there were 667 copies of <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a> sold! I wasn’t expecting anywhere near that number when I started, and I’ve been overwhelmed by the feedback. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="ha-tech">H&amp;A Tech</h2>

<p>In August, I left the company I was working for and started my own business. It was a fast and unnerving transition, but I’m thrilled to be where I am today. I’m able to work on the projects I love and build things with little or no delay. If I get a crazy idea, I can pursue it without worrying about politics or the red tape of company approvals. I wish I could have done this sooner.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Writing-a-Book-with-GitHub.jpg" /><p>A lot of time and effort go into writing a book. It gets even harder when you need to collaborate with your editor and make revisions.
<!--more--></p>

<p>All of the edits must be reviewed and approved. Do you keep the change or do you toss it? Multiply this by hundreds of edits (or in my case thousands) and the task is enormous. Even when you think you nailed a paragraph, it can come back shredded (that means it’s better in the end, right?).</p>

<p>When I wrote <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a> I used GitHub to manage all of the revisions and help me see the edits. I was doing all of my writing for the blog in Markdown and I didn’t want to change that workflow for the book.  It turned out to be a great choice.</p>

<h2 id="file-layout">File Layout</h2>

<p>I kept the file structure for the book really simple. A single markdown file for the outline and a single file for each chapter. I wrote the first draft for the entire book before I went back to start editing. When I finished editing each chapter I uploaded a copy of it to a DropBox folder I share with my editor. That allowed her to get started while I kept editing the later chapters.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-tiny" src="/assets/posts_extra/Writing a Book with GitHub/file_structure.jpg" /></p>

<p>I created a local git repository on my computer with the GitHub for Mac application. I could do it via command line, but I like the UI that comes with the app. Every time I made edits to the book, I committed the changes to save a history of the work I was doing.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-edits">Receiving Edits</h2>

<p>When my editor finished each chapter, she let me know via email or text. I created a new branch in my local repository that I used to overwrite my version of the chapter with hers. That gave me her edits on my machine with the GitHub application waiting for me to merge those changes. I read through each edit and made decisions.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Writing a Book with GitHub/github_edits.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was simple to see any adds, deletes, or comments that she made. The interface clearly showed what had been done to the file. If I needed to revise what she had done, I could jump over to the file in Sublime Text, make the edits, and save it. When I was done acting on her edits, I committed the changes and then merged them into my master branch in GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="version-history">Version History</h2>

<p>A big benefit of this process is the version history. I can look back on every commit I have made and roll back to that point in time. It keeps each revision and allows me to come back to them as needed. This is a huge load off of my brain. I don’t have to worry about making a change - I know I can always undo it or look back on what I did and see the progression.</p>

<p>I plan to use this method for any books I write in the future. I use GitHub quite a bit, so I’m comfortable with it and it makes the editing process painless. Well, at least logistically.</p>
