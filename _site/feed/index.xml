        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/the-flawed-foundation-of-diets.jpg" /><p>After working on multiple sides of agriculture and seeing how the back-end of the food industry operates, I’ve come to the realization that there is some really bad information out there about agriculture and how we decide what to eat.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Most of our decisions about what to eat are adopted from a huge list of diets. There are a lot of cultural diets, but anymore most Western diets are put together with a purpose in mind. Some of them help us put on muscle and some help lower cholesterol levels. There’s even a <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/japan/japan-long-breath-diet/">breathing diet</a> to help you lose weight. No matter the goal, diets face an underlying flaw in their design.</p>

<p>When you break it down, a diet is simply a recommendation on how to achieve health through the food that you consume. It’s a way of eating that provides you with a long, energetic life. But the problem we face today is the plethora of diets out there all claiming to be the best way to eat. A lot of these diets contradict each other and leave us wondering which ones are worthwhile. What’s worse is the regular discovery of new scientific evidence revealing the fact that some diets actually make us <em>less</em> healthy than we were originally.</p>

<p>Why is that? Let’s go back to the premise of what a diet is: a recommendation on how to eat. In order to make an honest and accurate recommendation we need information and experience with the thing we are recommending. Generally speaking, you wouldn’t ask a web developer to work on your car. Most developers don’t have the deep knowledge about cars that they would need to find the issue with your motor. The food industry is much the same.</p>

<p>The vast majority of diets are based on research done by scientists. We run across diets created by individuals once in a while but those typically have a base derived from the research done by scientists. We learn that antioxidants can help fight or prevent cancer, so we put together a recommendation on how to get more of them into our daily food intake. We even go to the extreme of adding them into products where they don’t naturally exist so that we can consume even more of them. But that mindset can give us <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antioxidants-may-make-cancer-worse/">alarming results</a>.</p>

<p>Any time we develop new research that shows a way to prevent or fight a disease or that shows the health benefits of a specific nutrient, we blow it out of proportion. You would think that with all the research being done and the experience we have with eating that we would know how to eat healthfully. Why can’t we get this right?</p>

<p>In order to make a perfect recommendation, you have to know <em>everything</em> about the thing you’re recommending. If you don’t know everything about it, there will inevitably be flaws in the rationale behind the recommendation. Sometimes those flaws are no big deal but sometimes they have unexpected results.</p>

<p>Say I recommend a wireless router to a friend. It’s one I’ve used for years and have a great experience with. My friend trusts me so he buys the router. He sets it up and has nothing but issues with it. I come over and give it a try with no luck. After digging into it, I find out that this router doesn’t play nice with his specific modem. I made what I thought was a great recommendation but it turned out to be a nightmare for my friend. If had known about the pairing issues of that combination, I wouldn’t have recommended it. I didn’t know <em>everything</em> about the router even though I thought it was excellent.</p>

<p>We have a lot of data about the human body. We understand things about it that our great-grandparents could only speculate about. And that means we have a ton of information at our disposal that we can use to build the perfect recommendation on how to eat. But remember what I said earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to make a perfect recommendation, you have to know <em>everything</em> about the thing you’re recommending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to make the perfect diet, we have to know <em>everything</em> about the human body. We have to know about every nutrient that exists, how they work in combinations, and what our digestive system does with each one. We also have to understand how we break those nutrients down and how they help brain function. We need to know how our nutritional needs change as we age and develop. But it turns out there’s a lot we don’t know about ourselves:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-we-know-about-the-brain-2015-5">What we know about the brain</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/round-up/ten-mysteries-of-you">Ten things we don’t understand about humans</a></p>

<p><a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/65435/scientists-discover-new-part-human-body">Scientists Discover a New Part of the Human Body</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/body%E2%80%99s-bacteria-don%E2%80%99t-outnumber-human-cells-so-much-after-all">Body’s bacteria don’t outnumber human cells so much after all</a></p>

<p>The other side of this is that we don’t even understand the food itself well enough to know how it fits into our own nutrition. Take the tomato for example. It’s consumed all over the world and yet we know very little about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/science/the-tomato-ripe-juicy-and-bursting-with-genes.html">why it has more genes</a> than we do. If we can’t explain everything about our own bodies and the food that we eat, how can we expect anyone to develop a diet that completely meets our nutritional needs?</p>

<p>It simply isn’t possible to develop a diet that is completely accurate and 100% reliable. We don’t know enough to do that. Yes, we can put together good guesses and see great results, but we often don’t see the long-term effects for many years and by that time we may have learned that it was actually a really bad idea all along.</p>

<p>Scientists are doing an excellent job of learning about us and the food we eat. We’ve been able to create diets for people struggling with diseases and help patients extend their lives and have a higher quality of life at the same time. There’s a lot of value in these continued attempts to make the best recommendations we can. And the more we learn about ourselves, the better these recommendations get. But we will very likely never have the ability to build the perfect diet and we will never be able to manufacture the perfect food.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we simply need to keep in mind that the diets we choose to follow are never ideal. Scientists are great at giving us information to follow, but we need to remember the basics when we decide what to eat.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Evernote-vs-Raw-Files.jpg" /><p>Ever since I published an <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/an-alternative-to-evernote/">article about leaving Evernote</a> I’ve received numerous recommendations for alternatives. It seems there is an endless supply of catchall buckets that you can drop information into.  I appreciate all the ideas, but it isn’t the point.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The majority of my complaints with Evernote revolve around portability and a proprietary format. It’s not an easy task to work with the notes in other applications and it’s not trivial to take the text out of the note, work on it, and bring it back in on iOS. But there are a lot of the details that have me avoiding Evernote and its alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="formatting-text">Formatting Text</h2>

<p>I just don’t do it. 95% of all my writing is in markdown. I’m even starting to do this when I take handwritten notes. The only time I don’t use markdown is when I’m creating a Pages document for a client, which is rare anymore. So I never have a need to create rich text in any way. That mostly stems from my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/choosing-the-right-medium/">medium of sharing words</a>: the web. Everything eventually ends up in HTML and the words I type that <em>don’t</em> end up on the web are short-form or for personal reference. In either case, I don’t have the need or the time to make something bold or change a font size. To me, it has just as much impact in its natural state as it does formatted.</p>

<h2 id="checklists">Checklists</h2>

<p>I used to keep all my checklists in Evernote. I even found a way to do <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/recurring-checklists-in-evernote/">recurring checklists in Evernote</a>. But that was before I moved <em>every</em> task item into OmniFocus. My Evernote lists worked great at the time, but I prefer the consolidation of every action item in one place and all reference material in a separate place.</p>

<h2 id="pictures-and-files">Pictures and Files</h2>

<p>One major benefit to using Evernote is the ability to keep pictures and files right alongside of the text that you’re storing. It’s an awesome feature, but it comes with a lot of downsides. What if I need to edit the picture or file? It’s rare that I don’t make changes to them in some way. It might be annotations or adding lines to a spreadsheet but if I want to do anything with them I need to make sure I’m on my Mac. It works pretty well there, but the moment you try this on iOS it gets really messy, really fast. The extra work and time involved in pulling it off is not for me. Keeping everything in a single folder in DropBox is much more compatible with the tools I prefer to use.</p>

<h2 id="storage-style">Storage Style</h2>

<p>I’m grateful for all the suggestions on alternatives to Evernote. I now know there are a lot of great ones out there. But I think I’ve developed a new (old?) information storage preference. I enjoy the flexibility of working with standard file types themselves. They’re easy to use and predict, and my use of them is not dependent on the features of a single company or application. If I want to make edits to my information, I don’t have to use a specific app to do it. And I can move from one system to another with little to no overhead and migration steps. I’m free from a single ecosystem; that’s what I like about it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/The-important-not-urgent-projects.jpg" /><p>We all have those projects that we <em>know</em> we should be working on, but without a deadline or someone relying on you it’s hard to keep it going. Things come up and the easy tasks to put off are the ones without urgency pushing them on.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I have a tendency to pick up a shiny new project and set aside the projects that move me toward my longer term goals. It’s easy to do because those long distance projects have no (noticeable) ramifications when they’re delayed. I can always make up the difference later or move the potential launch date back a bit without anyone noticing.</p>

<p>But that undermines my own mission. If I want to help others get better at their systems and develop a more meaningful life, I need to stay the course and keep working on the projects without a deadline and that have a bigger long-term impact.</p>

<p>I recently spent some time reflecting on these projects, trying to find time for them  each week. I wanted to put my hands to work instead of just thinking or talking, because “It’s the thought that counts” isn’t much of a business model. I thought about dedicating one or two days a week to them, but that would lead to slower progress in the end. What I really need to do is check something off for these projects every single day. They need to move forward every day no matter how small the progress is. Those incremental gains can make a big impact over time.</p>

<p>If I’m going to step up and work on these every day, it makes sense to create a checklist of the projects and tasks I need to complete each day. It also feeds my love of lists.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/the_important_not_urgent_projects/important-project-list.jpg" /></p>

<p>This shows up on my OmniFocus Dashboard every day and I go through it top to bottom along with everything else I do in the day. This means I set aside more of the “procrastiworking” tasks I tend to work on instead of my key projects, which is a good thing. There are some short-term sacrifices I make to do this but I don’t think anyone would say it’s not worth it.</p>

<p>To get a little more technical on the <em>how</em>, here are the settings I use for the project itself in OmniFocus:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-tiny" src="/assets/posts_extra/the_important_not_urgent_projects/important-project-settings.jpg" /></p>

<p>The idea is to flag the project to add it to my Dashboard (Due and Flagged), have it repeat every day, and mark the project complete after all tasks are completed.</p>

<p>Now I have a daily reminder and checklist that ensures I make progress on these important projects. I don’t care how small it is, but I <em>will</em> move them forward. It’s that small contribution each day that really adds up.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/And-Now.jpg" /><p>I ran across this idea when reading an article by <a href="https://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a>. The premise is simple: creating a frequently updated page to show what the person is currently doing. The concept really resonated with me, and I expanded on it a bit.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Sivers calls it a <em>Now</em> page and even created <a href="http://nownownow.com/">an index of these pages</a>. I started looking through these pages and loved a lot of the ideas I found. It was a classic case of being unable to make up my mind. So instead of picking one area or one page to keep updated, I built a site that showcases where my time goes, what I’m reading, what I’m currently developing, and a growing portfolio of my work.</p>

<p>In the future, I’d like to add an Apps page that keeps a list of the tools I’m using on my devices, but that’s an extensive addition, so it needs to come at a later time.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Timing-Tasks.jpg" /><p>In a previous role I spent some time researching project management software and evaluating it for company use. One of the turn-offs that my end users brought up was an extreme distaste for running a stopwatch on the tasks being tracked. I get it. No one wants to be stuck to a clock, especially when those reviewing the numbers are your managers.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I didn’t want to go that route either. I’ve always had a resistance to due dates, but some of it was fear that the data would be used against me. It would be hard not to compare my times to that of my coworkers. It wouldn’t matter if I came out better or not, quality of work would no longer be the main consideration if speed took over as the primary indicator.</p>

<p>When I started working for myself, I finally came around to the idea of starting a stopwatch at the beginning of every new task. The data was staying in my own hands. It could help me maximize my time without the potential for negative consequences. So I set up <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro/">a process with Launch Center Pro</a> to help track my time.</p>

<p>My intent was to understand where I spent the most time and look for places to cut back. I was seeking maximum impact for the least amount of time spent since every action I take can directly influence my income. But after timing my work for a while, I found there were more benefits to starting that stopwatch than I expected.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The first of these was my original (and only) intent: a record of how much time I spend on tasks. Keeping track of how much time I spend on tasks helps me see if I’m allocating too much of my day to one activity. I can’t say that I had any big <em>aha</em> moments as I’ve looked through the data, but it’s at least interesting to see how much time goes into writing an article or designing and building a website.</p>

<h2 id="estimations">Estimations</h2>

<p>Once I know how long something usually takes, I can estimate how much time to allocate to a task prior to starting. The past is the most accurate indicator of the future. This is why it’s so dangerous (and manipulative) to make even slight changes to history books and data records. If you want to honestly understand where you currently stand and how something will pan out in the future, you can study the past and see how things work out. History is an indicator for our actions in the present. The same is true for the time it takes to complete a task. The more we know about our completed tasks, the better we are at predicting the outcomes of our current and future tasks.</p>

<h2 id="self-competition">Self-Competition</h2>

<p>If we know how much time something usually takes us and we are about to begin a similar task, we have a benchmark to compare against. We have a time to beat. I think this holds the most value if you are the sole owner of the data and want to get better at the task. You can choose to let the time go longer if you’re working to improve the quality or you can work on speed if you’re trying to gain efficiency. In both cases, though, you know and understand your goal.</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>I was caught off-guard by this one. When I start that timer, I know that I’ll be recording the number when I’m done. The time will go into storage and into the broader history of the data I’ve  stored. The last thing I want to do is have that number include tasks outside of what I recorded. It will muddy the waters with false data, and I cannot <em>stand</em> false data. If I spend 10 minutes checking Twitter in the middle of designing a logo and I record it as time spent designing, the record is incorrect. So I take advantage of my loathing for bad data sets and use it to stay focused on the task.</p>

<h2 id="everything">Everything?</h2>

<p>Absolutely not. Don’t be crazy. You should not have a stopwatch running when you’re having coffee with your spouse. Only time the tasks that need a record or that tend to get away from you. Leisure and play should be allowed to roam. Tasks for work or your side projects are likely the primary commitments worth timing. Those are typically the only areas where we strive for efficiency and focus. It doesn’t work to be laser-focused while at the beach on vacation.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/A-Text-File-Weather-Forececast.jpg" /><p>It never fails. I sit at our kitchen table over breakfast and mention to my wife that it’s going to snow that day. The first question she asks? <em>“How much?”</em> I don’t know! All I know is that my alert says it’s supposed to happen!
<!--more--></p>

<p>After going through this exchange so many times that my wife realized she was driving me crazy <em>then continued to ask because she enjoys taunting me</em>, I gave up and created my own weather forecast. I wanted to know temperatures and precipitation amounts and keep a daily record of each forecast. I figured if I was going to go through the trouble of creating it, I might as well make it possible to search a date and get the forecast from that day. I turned to text files and Google Scripts.</p>

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" style="width:40%;" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_text_file_weather_forecast/weather-today.jpg" /></p>

<p>To set this up, you’ll need access to Google Drive and a <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api?apiref=6977fd0285651b13">developer account with Weather Underground</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new Google Apps Script in Google Drive.</li>
  <li>Paste the code below into the script.</li>
  <li>Replace the _X_s in the script with your Weather Underground API key and change the city/state to your location.</li>
  <li>Set up a trigger to run the function automatically (Resources &gt; Current project’s triggers).</li>
</ol>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_text_file_weather_forecast/app-trigger.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here’s the script you’ll need:</p>

<noscript><pre>function weatherLogger() {
  var url = &quot;http://api.wunderground.com/api/XXXXXXXXXXX/forecast/q/STATE/CITY.json&quot;
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
  var weather = JSON.parse(response);
  var summary = weather.forecast.simpleforecast.forecastday[0];
  var newFileData = summary[&quot;date&quot;][&quot;pretty&quot;] + &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;High temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;high&quot;][&quot;fahrenheit&quot;] + &quot;°F/&quot; + summary[&quot;high&quot;][&quot;celsius&quot;] + &quot;°C&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Low temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;low&quot;][&quot;fahrenheit&quot;] + &quot;°F/&quot; + summary[&quot;low&quot;][&quot;celsius&quot;] + &quot;°C&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Conditions: &quot; + summary[&quot;conditions&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Precipitation: &quot; + summary[&quot;qpf_allday&quot;][&quot;in&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Snow: &quot; + summary[&quot;snow_allday&quot;][&quot;in&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Max Wind Speed: &quot; + summary[&quot;maxwind&quot;][&quot;mph&quot;] + &quot;mph &quot; + summary[&quot;maxwind&quot;][&quot;dir&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Avg Wind Speed: &quot; + summary[&quot;avewind&quot;][&quot;mph&quot;] + &quot;mph &quot; + summary[&quot;avewind&quot;][&quot;dir&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Humidity: &quot; + summary[&quot;avehumidity&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Raw Data:&quot;;
  
  for (var key in summary) {
    var dataToLog = key + &quot;: &quot; + JSON.stringify(summary[key]);
    if (newFileData == &quot;&quot;) {
      newFileData = dataToLog;
    }
    else {
      newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
      newFileData += dataToLog;
    };
  };
  var today = new Date();
  var d = new Date(today);
  var y = d.getFullYear();
  var m = d.getMonth();
  m = m + 1
  m = &quot;00&quot; + m
  m = m.substr(m.length - 2);
  var day = d.getDate();
  day = &quot;00&quot; + day;
  day = day.substr(day.length - 2);
  var dateString = y + m + day;
  DriveApp.createFile(&quot;Weatherx_Todayx_&quot; + dateString + &quot;.txt&quot;, newFileData);
}</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joebuhlig/488a95d9072b6c8a1500.js"> </script>

<p>When run, the script will create a text file at the top-level of your Google Drive. From there you can use Hazel to move and rename these files however you like. For example, I use Hazel to rename the files to just the date and move them to DropBox within <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/text-file-setup-and-workflow/">my text file setup</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_text_file_weather_forecast/hazel-rule.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="yesterday">Yesterday</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" style="width:40%;" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_text_file_weather_forecast/weather-yesterday.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once I had today’s forecast working properly, I took the next step: keeping a history of what actually happened the day before. This was primarily so I could determine how much rain we had yesterday. I grew up on a crop farm. The most common question in a farming community is, “How much rain did you get last night?” That almost instinctual curiosity has never left me, but instead of setting up a rain gauge like most good farmers, I just altered my forecast script to give the data from the day before in the same format.</p>

<p>Everything for this historical record works the same as the forecast. The only difference is the location of the API call and the parsing of the data.</p>

<noscript><pre>function weatherLogger() {
  var url = &quot;http://api.wunderground.com/api/XXXXXXXXXXX/yesterday/q/STATE/CITY.json&quot;
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
  var data = JSON.parse(response);
  var summary = data.history.dailysummary[0];
  var slength = summary.length;
  var newFileData = summary[&quot;date&quot;][&quot;pretty&quot;] + &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;High temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;maxtempi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Low temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;mintempi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Avg temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;meantempi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Rain: &quot; + summary[&quot;rain&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Snow: &quot; + summary[&quot;snow&quot;] + &quot; &quot; + summary[&quot;snowfalli&quot;] + &quot; &quot; + summary[&quot;snowdepthi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Precipitation: &quot; + summary[&quot;precipi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Growing Degree Days: &quot; + summary[&quot;gdegreedays&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Max Wind Speed: &quot; + summary[&quot;maxwspdi&quot;] + &quot;mph&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Avg Wind Speed: &quot; + summary[&quot;meanwindspdi&quot;] + &quot;mph &quot; + summary[&quot;meanwdire&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Humidity: &quot; + summary[&quot;humidity&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Raw Data:&quot;;
  
  for (var key in summary) {
    var dataToLog = key + &quot;: &quot; + JSON.stringify(summary[key]);
    if (newFileData == &quot;&quot;) {
      newFileData = dataToLog;
    }
    else {
      newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
      newFileData += dataToLog;
    };
  };
  var today = new Date();
  var d = new Date(today);
  d.setDate(today.getDate() - 1);
  var y = d.getFullYear();
  var m = d.getMonth();
  m = m + 1
  m = &quot;00&quot; + m
  m = m.substr(m.length - 2);
  var day = d.getDate();
  day - 1;
  day = &quot;00&quot; + day;
  day = day.substr(day.length - 2);
  var dateString = y + m + day;
  DriveApp.createFile(&quot;Weatherx_Yesterdayx_&quot; + dateString + &quot;.txt&quot;, newFileData);
}

</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joebuhlig/d652e20182ed3c380e15.js"> </script>

<p>The benefit of having both of these in place is the ability to compare the forecast to what actually happened. The only issue with doing this is the result: it shows just how bad forecasts really are at predicting weather. But hey, at least breakfast with my wife is less maddening.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Choosing-OmniFocus-Settings.jpg" /><p>No application setup is complete without tweaking the settings to your liking. This is the power (and struggle) of OmniFocus. Some of the available options make drastic changes while others lead to subtleties you may not notice.
<!--more--></p>

<div class="callout">
	<div class="callout-book-cover">
		<a href="http://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">
			<img class="callout-image" src="/assets/base/WorkingWithOmniFocus-Small.png" />
		</a>
	</div>
	<blockquote style="border: 0px; text-align:center;">Stop searching for the right way to use OmniFocus. There isn’t one.</blockquote>
	<p>If you're interested in more detail about my OmniFocus setup, take a look at <a href="http://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">my book on it</a>. I pull back the curtain on the concepts and nuances of OmniFocus and how I work with it.</p>
</div>

<p>I use the Mac version of OmniFocus as the “home base” of my setup. I make most of my changes there and let them sync to iOS. There are a few settings specific to mobile, but the majority of the following options will be dedicated to OmniFocus 2 for Mac.</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/General_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>One of the most powerful advantages of high resolution screens is the ability to condense information and see the full context of the current task. The more you can see at once the easier it is to understand what’s going on. That’s one thing I love about being able to adjust the text size in OmniFocus. Try to make it as small as possible while still being able to read it. If you can see every task assigned to a project when you’re reviewing it, you can make a clearer decision about it.</p>

<p>It can be painful when vital keyboard shortcuts change on you. Muscle memory is not overcome without a number of frustrating mistakes. There were a number of simple keystrokes in OmniFocus 1 ingrained in my fingers that were changed in OmniFocus 2. You can revert to the old way by using the <em>Classic Mode</em> for outlining, but when applications make changes on this scale, it’s typically for a good reason and I try to bite the bullet and change with them. It’s always possible that the old way will be dropped entirely in the future. To save myself trouble later on, I use the <em>Modern Mode</em> for outlining. And to be honest, after switching it does make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>The <em>Quick Entry Shortcut</em> and the <em>Clippings Shortcut</em> are both settings you should tweak to your liking. I use a combination of the Spacebar and other modifier keys to invoke most blank capture and search mechanisms. So in my case I use Control + Option + Space to pull up the <em>Quick Entry Dialog</em>. If I’m capturing selected text or existing data, I use Command + Shift and a letter to indicate the program I want the data to land in. In this case, I use Command + Shift + O for the <em>Clippings Shortcut</em>.</p>

<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Organization_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>I highly recommend cleaning up items only when they have both a Project and a Context. This means new tasks only leave your inbox when they have both of these assigned; any other scenario leaves the task at risk of not being clearly defined. Even if there needs to be a placeholder context or project, it’s still better than making a partial decision about the task. Let this setting push you to be as clear as you can.</p>

<p>You have an option for doing this cleanup process automatically (as soon as the criteria is met) or when you change views or perspectives. I’ve found that it really depends on how you like to work with tasks. If you like to see completed tasks sitting there with a checkmark, set this to <em>When changing views</em>. But if you’re like me and you want your list to shrink as you check things off, set it to <em>Immediately</em>.</p>

<p>Do you have a tendency to create new projects already thought out with a series of tasks that must be completed in a set order? Or do you tend to add tasks as you think of them and most of your projects don’t follow a set pattern? In the case of the former, you will likely want all your new projects to start off as sequential. I fall into the latter category and prefer them to start as parallel. That allows me to keep adding tasks to the project and have them show up on my context lists immediately.</p>

<p>The last option here is for showing the projects and groups in your context lists. This is mostly preference. If you have a task group assigned to @Computer, that group will show up in your Computer context list. Personally, I feel that this adds clutter to my list, so I leave this unchecked.</p>

<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Layout_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>Remember what I said about data density? I think there’s a lot of value in condensed formats. Seeing as much information as I can at one time helps me understand the situation better. So I prefer to use the <em>Custom Columns</em>  or <em>Fluid</em> layouts. You can see the exact columns I’m using in the screenshot. Those specific columns help me make the best decision on the next task to work on.</p>

<h2 id="dates--times">Dates &amp; Times</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Date_Time_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>When do you want tasks to be marked as “Due Soon?” When you mark a task with a due date, when does that task show a yellow indicator? This really depends on how quickly your tasks come and go and how long it takes to complete them. In my case those combined criteria lead me to a five day lead time. I want an indicator when something is due in five days or less.</p>

<p>The next three settings are about default times. You’ll want to set these in a way that makes sense based on your daily schedule. When I defer a task I want it to show up the morning of the date I set, so I use midnight as the default defer time. I typically go to bed around 9pm, so I make sure tasks are completed by then if they are due. Finally, I want to make sure every project is reviewed weekly. In rare cases, I’ll adjust a project to go further out but the vast majority of my projects need a weekly look.</p>

<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>

<p>In 99% of cases, I turn off notifications from apps on my devices. There are very few alerts important enough to warrant a change in direction, but OmniFocus is an exception. If OmniFocus notifies me, I need to know about it. It is an indicator that I missed something and it needs to be dealt with immediately. I can’t afford to let those slide.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Notification_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>To help with getting my attention, OmniFocus has the ability to use “soft” alerts. These are the dock icon badge and perspective highlights. I use both to indicate when I have tasks that are due soon or flagged. I rely on my phone for these because I prefer a single place for alerts and since my phone is always with me, it makes sense as the central hub.</p>

<p>When I do get alerts, I want them to be important. I avoid due dates on my tasks as much as I can so when I see a badge icon or get a notification, it has some weight behind it. To maintain that importance, I limit alerts to tasks that are due in some way.</p>

<p>I don’t use it on my Mac nearly as much as my phone, but I really like having my Dashboard (flagged and due tasks) in my Today view. It’s nice to see this list with a single swipe.</p>

<p>I’ve never been a big fan of putting my tasks on the calendar. That may work for you, but I’ve never found a way to do that without creating my nemesis: clutter.</p>

<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Synchronization_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can get fancy with how you sync your data but I prefer to trust the Omni Group. They know their data better than I do, so I stick with their service to move the data around.</p>

<p>It’s good to get new features and bug fixes, so I enable checking for daily updates. I know that some folks prefer not to send information back to companies, and in some cases I might do the same. But the Omni Group has gained my trust and I want to help them continue to build a quality product. So in this case, I opt to send them anonymous data.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/A-Record-of-Completed-Tasks.jpg" /><p>There are times when I want to look back and see what I did on a specific day. This is extremely helpful when I need a record for a client, but no matter the reason, I find myself referring to my task history frequently.
<!--more--></p>

<p>There are two ways I access these completed tasks: in an OmniFocus perspective and in daily text files.</p>

<h2 id="daily-review">Daily Review</h2>

<p>The OmniFocus  perspective that I use to view my completed tasks is one of the stock perspectives, and doesn’t require a Pro account. Here are the specific settings I’m using:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_record_of_completed_tasks/completed-perspective.jpg" /></p>

<p>Some days it can be a challenge to pick up where I left off the day before. I can look at the upcoming tasks on my Dashboard but that doesn’t give me the context of what I  just finished doing for those projects. So at the end of my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a> I look over this Completed perspective. It’s a quick view of what I’ve been working on and helps me pick up where I left off.</p>

<h2 id="text-files">Text Files</h2>

<p>For longer term storage of completed tasks, I create text files detailing the progress of  tasks and projects that day. Under each project is a list of the completed tasks and their completion date.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_record_of_completed_tasks/task-report.jpg" /></p>

<p>The idea here is to create a historical record of what I did each day. It allows me to go back in time to any day I want and see exactly which projects I was working on and the progress I made.</p>

<h2 id="applescript-and-hazel">AppleScript and Hazel</h2>

<p>These text files are created automatically, because there’s no way I’m going to copy/paste the data into place every day. I wrote an AppleScript that creates them and the script is run by Hazel, so my Mac needs to be turned on to run it; I can’t see the text file for yesterday until my Mac has had a chance to run the script today. I should note that this script is designed to be an external script, not embedded. Here’s what the Hazel rule looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_record_of_completed_tasks/hazel-rule.jpg" /></p>

<p>And here’s the external AppleScript used in the rule:</p>

<noscript><pre>on hazelProcessFile(theFile)
	set filePath to &quot;/Users/JoeBuhlig/Dropbox/Text/TaskReports/&quot; -- Where to save the resulting text file (Be sure to add the trailing &quot;/&quot;)
	
	-- Create the new filename as YYYYMMDD.txt
	set todayDate to current date
	set yestDate to todayDate - 1 * days
	set {year:y, month:m, day:d} to yestDate
	set fileName to y * 10000
	set fileName to fileName + (m * 100)
	set fileName to fileName + d
	
	-- Set the starting date of the report
	set startDate to todayDate - 1 * days
	set startDate&#39;s hours to 0
	set startDate&#39;s minutes to 0
	set startDate&#39;s seconds to 0
	
	-- Set the ending date of the report
	set endDate to todayDate - 1 * days
	set endDate&#39;s hours to 23
	set endDate&#39;s minutes to 59
	set endDate&#39;s seconds to 59
	
	-- Create the blank report to build from
	set reportText to &quot;&quot;
	
	tell application &quot;OmniFocus&quot;
		tell front document
			set theProjects to every flattened project where its modification date is greater than startDate and modification date is less than endDate
			repeat with a from 1 to length of theProjects
				set currentProj to item a of theProjects
				set theTasks to (every flattened task of currentProj where its completed = true and completion date is greater than startDate and completion date is less than endDate)
				if theTasks is not equal to {} then
					set reportText to reportText &amp; return &amp; return &amp; &quot;------------------------------&quot; &amp; return &amp; name of currentProj &amp; return
					repeat with b from 1 to length of theTasks
						set currentTask to item b of theTasks
						set completedDate to completion date of currentTask
						set completedTime to time string of completedDate
						set reportText to reportText &amp; return &amp; name of currentTask &amp; &quot; ----- &quot; &amp; completedTime
					end repeat
				end if
			end repeat
			if reportText is equal to &quot;&quot; then
				reportText = &quot;Nothing completed for this day.&quot;
			end if
			set runTime to date string of (todayDate - 1 * days)
			set reportText to runTime &amp; return &amp; return &amp; reportText
			set newFile to open for access filePath &amp; fileName &amp; &quot;.txt&quot; with write permission
			write reportText to newFile
			close access newFile
		end tell -- end tell front document
	end tell -- end tell application &quot;OmniFocus&quot;
end hazelProcessFile</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joebuhlig/7e3a15b1d75cc1d745e5.js"> </script>

<h2 id="ios">iOS</h2>

<p>You’ll notice in the script that I’m saving the text files to my DropBox. The most common place for me to search these task reports is from my phone. With them syncing and being stored with the rest of my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/text-file-setup-and-workflow/">text file setup</a>, I can easily search for a task or project in Editorial and determine when I completed it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/A-Minimal-Alfred-Theme.jpg" /><p>I’ve got a bonus for you this week: my Alfred theme. I’ve tweaked the look of Alfred quite a bit over the few years I’ve been using it. I wanted something simple and unobtrusive, but I also wanted it to be compact and cram a lot of data into a small space. If that sounds appealing, give it a try.

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Favorite-Alfred-Tricks.jpg" /><p>My Mac is useless without <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>. That’s no joke. I try to use my wife’s profile once in a while. It’s painful for me and hilarious for her to watch. I keep hitting the Alfred shortcuts and staring at it like it’s broken.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I didn’t get this dependent overnight. I started using Alfred a few years ago and have slowly built up the number of use cases I have for it. So if you’re just starting out, don’t feel like you need to adopt a whole bunch of things at once. Find one or two that you know you’ll use and build from there. Here are some of the ways I use Alfred.</p>

<h2 id="launching-apps">Launching Apps</h2>

<p>I mentioned this in a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/mac-navigation/">previous article</a>, but it bears repeating because it’s so important. I rarely use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_%28OS_X%29">Mission Control</a> on the Mac. I’d rather jump straight to an app without hunting down the window that looks like the one I want. I set up workflows (Powerpack feature) that allow me to hit a keyboard shortcut and show/hide the app I want. This pulls up the app I want without a misfire.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-show-app-shortcut.jpg" alt="Alfred App Launch" /></p>

<h2 id="clipboard-history">Clipboard History</h2>

<p>I copy text and links all the time, and sometimes I need to copy/paste multiple portions of text at once. Take my weekly <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/newsletter">newsletter</a> for example. It has the title, excerpt, and link for each post that was published that week. I could flip back and forth nine times and get everything copied over, but that’s ridiculous. Instead I pull up each post, copy all the pieces I need, and use the clipboard history in Alfred to paste each piece without flipping between apps.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-clipboard-history.jpg" alt="Alfred Clipboard History" /></p>

<h2 id="email">Email</h2>

<p>I use Google Apps for my email and haven’t found a need for a local client because the web client works so well. This means checking my email requires entering the url for Gmail, and because I run a few different accounts I need to be able to pinpoint the exact email address. Using TextExpander, I set up a snippet that expands to the url for the account I want and presses Enter. Invoking Alfred and entering my snippet abbreviation sends me directly to my email. Though sometimes I wonder if I’ve made this too easy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">xemp</code> = <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox%key:enter%</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">xemjb</code> = <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox%key:enter%</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">xemfh</code> = <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#inbox%key:enter%</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="searching-files">Searching Files</h2>

<p>This is a pretty standard way to use a launcher like Alfred. And if you’re just getting started with one, it’s a good place to start. If I need to open a file, I rarely go to Finder. I almost always start typing into Alfred.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-file-search.jpg" alt="Alfred File Search" /></p>

<h2 id="font-awesome">Font Awesome</h2>

<p>Because I develop for the web, I use the <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> library of icons a lot. It’s a part of nearly every website I’ve worked with. So when I ran across a <a href="https://github.com/ruedap/alfred2-font-awesome-workflow">workflow</a> for searching and pasting in the classes for every icon, I installed it immediately.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-font-awesome.jpg" alt="Alfred Font Awesome" /></p>

<h2 id="dictionarythesaurus">Dictionary/Thesaurus</h2>

<p>I find myself looking for synonyms and definitions quite a bit, and Alfred makes it really easy on me. It has a built-in mechanism for searching the dictionary for a word and offering synonyms. I did change the keyword needed to search the dictionary from <em>define</em> to <em>def</em>,  just to make it a bit quicker.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-define.jpg" alt="Alfred Define" /></p>

<h2 id="somedaymaybe-lists">Someday/Maybe Lists</h2>

<p>Because I keep so many idea lists, I wanted a quick way to pull them up. So I created a workflow in Alfred that uses the keyword <em>ofsm</em>. It opens a link (copied from OmniFocus) to my folder of Someday/Maybe lists.</p>
