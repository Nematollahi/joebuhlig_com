        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/creating-custom-web-searches-in-alfred.jpg" /><p>Searching is one of the most technically complicated processes to build and yet the simplest to use. And it’s almost universally accepted that every website has a way to search the entirety of their content. Connect this with the ability to search websites directly from Alfred and you can create a one-stop shop for searching all your favorite sites.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Alfred can do searches in Google and many other websites out-of-the-box. But if you notice yourself searching a specific website repeatedly, it makes sense to set up a custom search within Alfred. If you continually repeat this process, you’ll end up using Alfred for all your searches instead of going through the multiple steps required to open a site, find the search bar, and type your query.</p>

<p>To set up a new custom search, you first need to know how the site handles search queries from a URL standpoint. For joebuhlig.com, this is what that looks like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">http://joebuhlig.com/search/?q=</code></pre></figure>

<p>Once you have that information, open Alfred preferences, go to Features, then Web Search. At the bottom-right you’ll see “Add Custom Search.” From there, simply fill out the details you want for the search. Here’s the full example for this site:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="http://cdn.joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/creating-custom-web-searches-in-alfred/alfred-custom-search.jpg" /></p>

<p>To make it even easier, you can <a href="alfred://customsearch/Search%20joebuhlig.com%20for%20%7Bquery%7D/joe/utf8/nospace/http%3A%2F%2Fjoebuhlig.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3D%7Bquery%7D">click here to install it directly</a>.</p>

<p>Using this search is quite simple. Invoke Alfred, type “joe” followed by your query. It’ll look like this:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-large" src="http://cdn.joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/creating-custom-web-searches-in-alfred/alfred-search.jpg" /></p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/using-discourse-for-it.jpeg" /><p>I’m a fan of <a href="http://discourse.org">Discourse</a>. That should come without surprise at this point. As a fan, it’s natural for me to see the potential for Discourse to solve communication problems and create selective visibility within an organization. So it was easy for me to gravitate toward it for the IT communication structure at my church.
<!--more--></p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, there are four areas that need to be clearly conveyed and accessible to those I support: technology needs, how tos, structural upgrades, and technical documentation. In my case, I have two groups of people to work with: staff members and tech volunteers. The staff needs to share their support requests and have access to the knowledgebase, while the tech team handles the infrastructure and documentation.</p>

<p>In Discourse, this translates quite well. I can create four topic categories (Support, How To, Infrastructure, and Documentation), and two user groups (<code class="highlighter-rouge">staff_members</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">tech_team</code>).  Distinguishing by user groups, I can restrict access as needed in each category.</p>

<p>In my case, there are some end users that will likely struggle if I require them to use Discourse directly. I don’t say this to be mean but to acknowledge that their strengths are outside of computer systems. Understanding this, I take advantage of the email-in feature of Discourse as well as reply-via-email.</p>

<p>My users can send an email to the system and have it handled automatically. Whether it’s a new ticket or a reply to a support update, they can interact solely from their email. Outside of setting up their accounts, they never have to access the system directly. They can stick to what they know: email.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of how each category is used:</p>

<h2 id="support">Support</h2>

<p>This is used primarily for issues and support tickets. Both the staff and tech team can access it and users can send an email into this category. When one of these is completed, I simply close the topic.</p>

<h2 id="how-to">How To</h2>

<p>These topics are checklists or videos explaining how to accomplish a specific task within our building and structures. These can range from website updates to installing printer drivers. Again, this is viewable by both staff and the tech team, but currently I have it restricted so only I can create new topics. I want to vet these before they’re posted.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Only the tech team can use this one. It’s designed to capture and discuss system upgrades and migrations as well as the little things we need in order to improve the reliability and functionality of our hardware and software. I think of it as a technical version of the support category.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>Again, this is tech team only. And most of these topics are wiki-fied so that team members can update them as changes are made. These can be descriptions of VLANs or they may list the base computers we use when a replacement is needed. Anything that helps describe the infrastructure so that others can step in should go here.</p>

<p>I’m aware that there are a lot of software options available that are specifically designed for these purposes. And the number of communication methods is endless. But after having worked with and for multiple companies, I’ve seen the pros and cons of using many of them. In most cases the IT team ends up hacking them together to do what they want. Or worse, they lose track of a request in the stream of posts.</p>

<p>What I love about Discourse is its flexibility and configurability. I can dial up or down individual pieces and even allow end-users to avoid it entirely. Telling my staff members that they simply need to send email is tremendously more effective than training how to navigate a new piece of software.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/hybrid-productivity.jpg" /><p>There’s a common misconception in the productivity world that when you develop a new process or system it needs to be entirely digital or entirely analog. Or the more common version of this dilemma: to work toward the use of a single database for your tasks. That may be nice, but it’s far from necessary.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In one week, I join the staff of our local church as Director of IT. As a part of that role, there needs to be a way to track the projects I have going on at the church. A handful of other folks will also be participating in the collection of those projects, as well as taking ownership of them.</p>

<p>For this reason (and many others), I set up a <a href="http://discourse.org">Discourse forum</a> to help me manage the work I do at the church. I can try to duplicate tasks and projects across Discourse and OmniFocus, but why? Yes, this creates two systems to maintain but they serve completely separate purposes. They need to be broken up.</p>

<p>The key here lies in boundaries and hard lines. OmniFocus manages the work I personally need to do and Discourse will track the work I need to do at the church. But this only works if I treat the church as its own context. I work off of Discourse when I am “on the clock.” I shut it off when I’m on my own time.</p>

<p>The same process works with digital tools combined with analog. As long as there are clear lines where one drops off and the other picks up, all is well. It’s when you try to mix systems, duplicate tasks, and create sync methods that issues arise and unnecessary problems surface. It’s okay to use multiple systems.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail.jpeg" /><p>In the midst of reading for <a href="http://bookworm.fm">Bookworm</a>, I discovered my habit of quickly checking my email throughout the day. It’s a simple habit on the surface, but try to break it and you’ll find that willpower alone may not be enough to win.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I set out to create resistance to checking my email from my phone. I can remove it entirely but I have legitimate scenarios that dictate the checking of email on the go. Since I can’t remove it, I decided to force difficulties when opening an email in any scenario.</p>

<p>Instead of removing email on my phone, I wrote a Google Apps Script that moves any read message in my inbox to the archive. And it does so once every minute. It’s basic and seems to not accomplish much since the messages end up in my archive anyway. But what if I need to reply? What if I need to act on that email? If I open it and don’t reply immediately or don’t capture in some way, it’s gone. Not completely, but it’s moved out of sight. And I will likely drop the ball since there is no placeholder in my inbox. That by itself is enough to keep me from opening mails on my phone. I can’t have them disappear.</p>

<p>I should warn you that if you decide to set this up, it will be frustrating at first. I failed immediately and checked my email shortly after installing the script. I saw a message I wanted to read but knew I couldn’t touch it or it would be gone since I didn’t have time to act on it. I spent a lot of time trying to get around this setup and quickly found that I couldn’t check a mail without a lot of extra steps. It’s a lot easier to not check it at all.</p>

<p><strong>Warning: Before going further, make sure read messages are ready to be archived. They will be moved.</strong></p>

<p>To set this up you need to go to your Google Drive and created a new Google Apps Script. Here’s the code to paste into that script:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">autoArchiveGmail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">threads</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">GmailApp</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">search</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'label:inbox is:read'</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">threads</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">threads</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nx">moveToArchive</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To run it the first time, click the debugger icon and give the script access to your Gmail:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail/debugger.jpg" /></p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail/permissions.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once the script is in place, set up a new trigger for it:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail/trigger_menu.jpg" /></p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-large" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail/trigger.jpg" /></p>

<p>I wish you all the best in checking email from your phone.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/food-and-productivity-from-a-farm-boy.jpeg" /><p>We all need to eat. The consequences of rejecting that fact are far from pleasant and none of us would argue this reality. The problem comes when choosing which foods to consume. It’s not enough that our supermarkets are overflowing and options are endless; we have corporate marketing schemes, dietary standards, and fear mongering to battle.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I was raised on a large crop farm and I have worked with, for, and around farmers and agricultural companies my entire life. In my journey I’ve helped raise crops and animals, develop new seed varieties and hybrids, and aided the marketing efforts of all the above. I understand what goes on behind the scenes of our food system quite well. And it’s this understanding that has given me clarity in choosing what to eat.</p>

<p>Some of these choices are purely for health reasons. Some are made out of a concern of the unknown or the constantly changing science of diet. But regardless of the rationale behind these decisions, they all lead me to an increase in energy and mental precision. And you could argue that these two results are the foundation of productivity, which means the justification I’ve developed for what I eat is tied not only to a healthy diet but also to my ability to complete tasks.</p>

<p>Enough of the groundwork, let’s jump in with an easy one: processed foods. Most people I encounter understand that these are best left alone. I like to think of them in terms of natural and manufactured complexity. In its natural state, a potato has a lot of complexity to it. There are a lot of nutrients in the skin as well as the heart. But it’s the combination of the two parts that allows it to achieve its dietary value.</p>

<p>But when you remove an element of the potato and introduce a foreign element, you have now manufactured a new complex arrangement of nutrients. Or in some cases, an element is removed and then replaced with a theoretically identical element that comes from a different, cheaper source. In either case, we’ve created a food item that doesn’t exist naturally in our environment. Some scenarios indicate that this is perfectly fine. But most lead to health issues due to a lack of understanding in how to create a food that is perfectly digested and beneficial to the human body. Or, as in most companies, the desire to create a healthy, processed food is secondary to profit.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult and hotly debated conversations you can have about food revolves around GMOs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism">Genetically Modified Organisms</a>. These are crops that have received a DNA alteration in order to enhance or add a trait within the crop. This usually leads people to seeing them as “frankenfoods” but that’s an exaggeration of the facts. The traits being added are typically found within the same species, just not the specific strain that’s being altered. This isn’t always the case, but generally speaking it holds true. The idea of pulling traits from strawberries and combining them with corn is mythology and typically used by fear mongers.</p>

<p>That said, there are tremendous benefits to GMOs. They’ve enabled food producers to grow exponentially higher yields and feed the world with fewer resources and less land. And it is true that they’ve helped farmers cut back significantly on the volume of chemicals used on their land. I’ve seen this transition first hand and I can tell you that the numbers you see on this are conservative. GMOs have proven highly beneficial to everyone raising crops.</p>

<p>However, there is a growing concern over the safety of GMOs. Despite there being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_crops#Crops">small number of GM crops they have been approved</a>, it <em>is</em> true that they make it into our food system. Which begs the question, are they safe for me to eat?</p>

<p>You can answer this question one of two ways: scientifically or with cautious reasoning. If you read the studies on GMOs, you’ll quickly conclude that they are perfectly safe. But to land at this conclusion you have to trust the source of the studies. In most cases, that source is either the company selling the GM crop or the company selling its processed form to you and me. Personally, I’m not convinced they’re able to do these studies with a completely unbiased approach. And knowing that some of these researchers (I’ve worked with them) will repeat a study multiple times looking for a particular result, I’m often skeptical of their findings.</p>

<p>The other way to answer the GMO safety question is with cautious reasoning. We know that eating whole fruits and vegetables is good for our bodies. There seems to be a perfect relationship between our physical needs and the offerings of these whole foods. If we intentionally alter the makeup of these foods genetically or with post-harvest processing, we are breaking this existing relationship and introducing a new one. It also means that how our bodies react may have unwanted effects on our energy and overall health. This new relationship <em>could</em> work out to be fine. But we’re introducing risk, since there’s so much about the human body we don’t know. We can’t truly comprehend the full impact this new relationship has on our long-term health. I don’t understand why I should voluntarily take this risk. Why would I choose the unknown when the known has a long list (and history) of benefits?</p>

<p>Just to be clear, <em>I’m not saying you should completely avoid and vilify GM foods.</em> They do have a place and save lives daily. But if given a choice and available resources, I err on the side of caution.</p>

<p>Given my experiences, I have learned that eating healthfully has a major impact on my ability to think clearly and creatively. And the better I feel, the better equipped I am to be productive. So to be wise with my time and energy, I need to eat well. For me, that means the consumption of simple, natural foods.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/stop-the-should.jpeg" /><p>One of the strongest fears I grapple with is that of rejection. Like most, I want people to appreciate the work I do and me as a person. My struggle develops when I sense a dislike or underappreciation directed towards me in some way. Red flags start flying and I find myself searching for ways to get out of the scenario.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Over time, I’ve learned who to trust and when. And although I rarely follow through on my thoughts about running away, I still have this nagging sense about what is expected of me. Instead of acting on my fear, I try to weigh it and pay attention to what the other person expects me to do.</p>

<p>However, this presupposition of actions can also rear its head in situations involving only myself. There are times when I feel the need to incorporate something new into my daily schedule. The latest case here is my need for more sleep. Rather than sleep longer at night, I’ve felt that an afternoon nap would better suit me. The fear and “should” that creeps in is telling me that I don’t have time for a nap everyday. I have enough to do. I can’t pull more time away for “leisure.”</p>

<p>Here’s the problem with these scenarios: they leave me feeling like I should say or do something because unspoken expectations have been placed on me. I’m expected to go along with a conversation I don’t agree with. I’m expected to maximize my time perfectly every day. I’m expected to utilize every app or tool to its fullest potential.</p>

<p>These are all things I <em>should</em> do. And when I stop long enough to notice when a “should” has been placed on me, I often find myself asking why. Why should I do this thing? “Because Joe expects it” or “because I paid decent money for this app” aren’t always the best answers. It’s taken time (and I’m still learning) to put a stop to the “should” that is placed on me and gain the confidence to think for myself.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/a-roller-coaster-relationship-with-books.jpeg" /><p>I was an avid reader in grade school. Any program the school put in place to encourage kids to read, I completed as fast as I could. That trend continued until I made it to junior high.
<!--more--></p>

<p>It wasn’t that I didn’t have time, but my rationale and purpose for reading changed. In grade school, I was encouraged to read but it wasn’t a requirement. In junior high, it became homework. Books were selected for me and I hated it. Maybe it was the timing or maybe it was my rebellious side showing its face, but either way I avoided reading as much as possible.</p>

<p>This avoidance continued until late in high school, and the only reason I read a couple books then was because my English teacher assigned books I had a genuine interest in. I can only say this having reflective hindsight. At the time I would say it was due to me liking the teacher. So, as you can guess, it didn’t stick. At the end of high school and early in college I still found myself getting clever at finding book summaries and honing my ability to skim the book for the high points.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I’ve always enjoyed having finished a book, when I <em>actually</em> read it. That’s a common thread with me; I enjoy the results of hard work but struggle to convince myself to do it. This certainly held true with reading books. I enjoyed being able to talk about a book I had read but didn’t want to start another one. Talk about a weird paradox.</p>

<p>After college I read about a book per year. Because I was no longer reading as homework, I again found pleasure in the reading itself. I could enjoy reading what I wanted, but still didn’t see it as something worth making into a habit.</p>

<p>And then there’s <a href="http://bookworm.fm">Bookworm</a>. An endeavor that has forced me into a reading habit. Bookworm took me from finishing roughly a book each year to completing a book every two weeks. And that has led to reading an extra book between some shows, which means I often read a book each week. This is easily the most reading I’ve done in my life.</p>

<p>Bookworm (and my new habit of carrying a book with me everywhere) has given me a chance to discuss the reading of books more frequently and it seems most folks I run into want to read more but don’t make the time for it.</p>

<p>My point is this: I haven’t always been a reader. It’s something I’ve grown into over time. I can tell you that if you aspire to read a book every week, you’ll likely struggle if you don’t currently read at least one every year. Going 0 to 100 rarely works. Instead, find a page count you can read every day. Even if it’s only one page every day, you’ll end up finishing a book and a half each year. If you can do five pages, you’ll land at about eight books a year. It doesn’t take much to start a habit that quickly compounds itself. Start small and be consistent; let it build over time.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/using-the-permanence-of-paper-as-resistance.jpeg" /><p>The concept of resistance is getting to be common knowledge. In its original context as posed by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Steven Pressfield</a>, resistance is entirely negative. It is the internal and sometimes external force keeping us from doing our best work. As good brainworkers we consistently look for tactics, methodologies, and habits to remove and eliminate resistance.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But there’s another side to resistance. You can take the inverse process and instead of removing resistance to doing the positive, you end up creating resistance to prevent the negative. In part, it’s this inverse relationship with resistance that has me using pen and paper for my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-day-on-paper/">daily planning</a>.</p>

<p>I appreciate uniformity and order. That’s a piece of why I build and enjoy structures and systems. It’s also natural for me to write my daily plans in the same format every day. And I don’t like drawing lines through a plan I’ve already made to accommodate a change. Granted, things happen and I’m okay with alterations if it’s an external input dictating the change. But if it’s just me, I don’t want to change it because it will destroy the cleanliness of the plan.</p>

<p>Type A, I know. But that’s how I think. The beauty is that I can create my goal for the day and know that when I put it on paper it pains me to change it after-the-fact. And when I go through the day following the plan and don’t feel like doing the next step, I know that putting it off requires a disruption in the cleanliness of what I’ve written on paper. Strange as it is, I would rather do the unwanted task than break up the structure I’ve created.</p>

<p>I find it interesting how big an impact these little habits can have on the outcome of a day. I may be doing the same process on paper as I can digitally, but because pen and paper have more permanence than an event in my calendar, I’m more prone to following the plan.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/the-day-on-paper.jpeg" /><p>I have tried numerous methods of managing my daily tasks digitally. But no matter the tool or the method, I am unable to replicate the clarity and motivation that comes from using pen and paper to plan and reflect on my day.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Don’t misunderstand. I still rely on digital tools heavily for everything beyond today. OmniFocus and my calendar play a big part in helping me determine what each day looks like. And my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-omnifocus-dashboard/">Dashboard</a> is vital to the execution process.</p>

<p>But planning the day out in my digital calendar doesn’t work. I’ve tried it multiple times. There’s something motivating and more permanent involved in pen and paper. I can’t drag-and-drop a commitment to a different time of day when I used pen. And the longer I commit my plan to paper, the more I’ve learned about myself when the day is done. This learning process has shown me a need for putting three separate portions of my day on paper.</p>

<h2 id="budgeting-my-time">Budgeting My Time</h2>

<p>I’ve talked about this in multiple places, but I find great value in planning each minute ahead of time. I list the date at the top and the hours down the side. While reviewing my calendar and Dashboard, I decide what I will do at each point in the day. This usually happens at night when I’m shutting down the house and prepping for bed.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/the-day-on-paper/daily-time-budget.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="three-things">Three Things</h2>

<p>To the right of my schedule and on the same page, I write down the three things I need to get done that day (or if I’m doing it the night before, the next day). Above all else, these are my goals to complete. Having no more than three means I can easily recall them throughout the day. Committing to no less than three means I’m not taking it easy. Sometimes I draw a line under them and list a few nice-to-haves, but those are ancillary and I try not to touch them until my three are complete.</p>

<h2 id="journal-entry">Journal Entry</h2>

<p>My schedule for the day and my three things go on the left side of the fold in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/analog-writing-organization/">my notebook</a>. The right side is for my reflection journal at the end of the day. Some people have a list of prompts they use for journal entry. That’s too much for me. I look at my commitments left of the fold as compared to what I accomplished and write about how I did. Did I check everything off or come up short? It’s the daily comparison of intentions to execution that keeps me coming back to pen and paper.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/behind-the-scenes-of-working-with-omnifocus.jpg" /><p>More often than not, I find myself surprised by the questions I get after releasing a new script or product. After releasing <a href="https://workingwithomnifocus.com">Working With OmniFocus</a> I received more emails about how the site is set up then I did about the course itself. It’s apparent to me that this is something different that others are interested in. So here’s how I did it.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="wordpress">WordPress</h2>

<p>The core is WordPress. It’s fast and easy to set up and I knew going this route would open a lot of doors to existing code. I could build the thing myself, but never in the same amount of time. There’s a lot of flexibility in WordPress and I’m very familiar with it.</p>

<h2 id="a-small-orange">A Small Orange</h2>

<p>Anytime I build a new WordPress site, I turn to <a href="https://asmallorange.com/">A Small Orange</a> for the hosting. I can run my own server through <a href="https://m.do.co/c/b0f9f06b6067">Digital Ocean</a> but the peace of mind from handing it off is worth it to me. And frankly, the set up time is much faster and more painless with ASO. Throw in fast, quality support and I’m sold.</p>

<h2 id="paid-memberships-pro">Paid Memberships Pro</h2>

<p>The membership mechanism I prefer is <a href="https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/">Paid Memberships Pro</a>. I like the single, yearly cost of PMPro and the extreme flexibility made possible by their add-ons and codebase. It takes care of my restricted content, payment gateways, the affiliate program, and email newsletter. And buying their annual license allows me to use it across an unlimited number of sites, which is great for building multiple online courses.</p>

<h2 id="theme-my-login">Theme My Login</h2>

<p>I don’t know why more sites don’t use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/">Theme My Login</a>. It seems very unprofessional to me when I am presented with the standard WordPress login screen on your site. TML fixes that and it’s free. Use it.</p>

<h2 id="vimeo">Vimeo</h2>

<p>I chose <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> for hosting the videos themselves for two main reasons: embedding control and their player API. I don’t want the videos discoverable anywhere but on my site. That’s how I can make it a paid course. And the API is what allows me to check for the amount of a video that’s been watched by the user, which is important for VimPosts.</p>

<h2 id="wp-vimposts">WP VimPosts</h2>

<p>This is the part most folks ask about. VimPosts is a WordPress plugin I wrote specifically for Working With OmniFocus. It’s what allows me to embed the Vimeo video by adding only the ID number to the WordPress post. It uses the Vimeo player API to decide when to mark a video as “watched” and gives the user the ability to manually trigger “watched” as well. It also creates a shortcode I can use within a WordPress page for creating a list of videos like you <a href="https://workingwithomnifocus.com/list/">see here</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, this plugin is dependent on the Working With OmniFocus website and will break anywhere else. But in my work on Working With Alfred, I plan to make it a standalone plugin. If you’re interested in staying up with the development process, <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/wp-vimposts">I have it on GitHub</a>. I have some new features planned for it and have considered making it available as a premium plugin but I’m currently undecided. If it’s something you’re interested in using, let me know in the comments below.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/checking-in-on-dvorak.jpeg" /><p>It’s been about 10 months since I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/dvorak-transition/">switched to Dvorak</a>. It’s been at least six months since I’ve <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/is-dvorak-worth-it/">written about it</a>. In that six months, I have continued to make improvements but I’ve also noticed an interesting tidbit about my relationship with QWERTY.
<!--more--></p>

<p>First, I’m loving Dvorak. I didn’t have RSI issues beforehand but I can tell there’s less strain on my fingers now. I have no solid numbers on it but I like knowing I can feel the difference. And given the large amount of time I keep my finger tips on keys every day, I can’t help but think this is smart in the long-term.</p>

<p>As for typing speed, I’m still climbing. I’m currently sitting at 118 words a minute. I keep thinking it will plateau but though the rate of increase has slowed significantly, it is still moving upward. I’m guessing it will peak somewhere around 125.</p>

<p>As expected, my QWERTY speed has dropped but lately it’s been holding steady at about 40 words a minute. By my standards that’s pretty terrible, but considering I rarely use QWERTY and am not trying to maintain it, I’m fine with that number. It’s still high enough that I don’t appear to be a complete fool when I use it. At least most of the time.</p>

<p>But here’s the catch: I can’t think about it too hard. If I just type, it works out great no matter which layout I’m on. But if I’m on QWERTY and I try to be intentional about the keys and focus on them, it all comes crumbling down. I have to watch my hands and really work at it.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m still really happy I made the switch. There are some difficulties with being “not normal” but to me it’s worth it. I can deal with the slight setbacks for the sake of the benefits.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/discourse-commenting-for-jekyll.jpg" /><p>For years, Disqus has been the commenting platform of choice. It’s what I used when my site was on WordPress. When I switched to a static site generated by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, I pulled commenting entirely. But given the topics I write about, comments can be quite helpful and I realize that was a mistake. So I brought them back with the help of <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<p>There are a number of reasons I chose Discourse, but suffice it to say that I just like it better than the alternatives, which are actually few in number for static sites. I have a unique way of doing the embed process that I thought other Jekyll users might find helpful.</p>

<h2 id="the-discourse-side">The Discourse Side</h2>

<p>Assuming you have an instance of Discourse running (not the purpose of this post) and you are an admin on said instance, you add the host site as an allowed host in the Discourse settings (Customize → Embedding). That will generate the code you need to embed on each page you want commenting enabled. You’ll have to change the embed URL within the code to match the canonical URL of the page it’s embedded on. This is what it looks like originally:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'discourse-comments'</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">discourseUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'http://discussion.joebuhlig.com/'</span><span class="p">,</span>
                     <span class="na">discourseEmbedUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'REPLACE_ME'</span> <span class="p">};</span>

  <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'script'</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'text/javascript'</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">async</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">src</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">discourseUrl</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">'javascripts/embed.js'</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'head'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'body'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]).</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">})();</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="the-jekyll-side">The Jekyll Side</h2>

<p>This can’t get more basic. Paste the code from Discourse to the bottom of the post layout in Jekyll. After I make the edit for the embed URL, this is what the code looks like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'discourse-comments'</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">discourseUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'http://discussion.joebuhlig.com/'</span><span class="p">,</span>
                     <span class="na">discourseEmbedUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'{{site.url}}{{page.url}}'</span> <span class="p">};</span>

  <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'script'</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'text/javascript'</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">async</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">src</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">discourseUrl</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">'javascripts/embed.js'</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'head'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'body'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]).</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">})();</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="development-tweaks">Development Tweaks</h2>

<p>Every change I make to the site is previewed before deployment. Each post is reviewed as well. So it’s quite normal for me to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll s --future</code>. But I don’t want any issues with the embed code when I’m in my development environment, so I tell Jekyll to only add the embed code when the site is being created for production:</p>

<p>Now when I’m ready to deploy my changes I run <code class="highlighter-rouge">JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll b</code>. That sets the environment variable to production instead of development and means the embed code is only included when I’m building the site for real. I use the same trick for my Piwik tracking code. It keeps my external dependencies from creating issues while I am developing.</p>
