        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/textexpander-and-omnifocus.jpeg" /><p>TextExpander and OmniFocus are <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/first-apps-on-a-new-mac/">two of the first tools</a> I install on any new device, so it’s no surprise that the two work well together. You may expect some kind of Applescripting or shell magic, but I keep this extremely simple and only use true text expansion with OmniFocus. I run the scripts manually or behind the scenes with Hazel.
<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>xwait = “Waiting for “</strong></p>

<p>This is easily the most commonly used snippet I have for OmniFocus. Any time I need to create a new Waiting For task, I always type <em>xwait</em> and keep going. It’s not a huge savings in one instance but multiply this by the average 20 uses a day and it really adds up.</p>

<p><strong>xresp = “Waiting for response from “</strong></p>

<p>Similar to the first, I use this one a lot. I receive and send a ton of email. Any time I send one that warrants a response, a new task is created and this is where the naming starts.</p>

<p><strong>xplan = “Plan project for “</strong></p>

<p>Most of the time when I decide to take on a new project, I don’t have time right then to plan it out. So I use this to create a task for the planning process.</p>

<p><strong>xpfm = “Plan for meeting re: “</strong></p>

<p>I don’t use this as much as I used to, but this helps me create a new task as a reminder to review meeting materials and get resources together for a call.</p>

<p><strong>xlook = “Look into “</strong></p>

<p>I do a ton of research to help me get better at a project or learn how a new process works. I always start these tasks with “Look into” as an indicator to Google, read, or learn about the item.</p>

<p><strong>xdwc = “ (Delete when complete)”</strong></p>

<p>I stole this one from <a href="http://www.usingomnifocus.com">Kourosh</a>. I sometimes have repeating tasks that are creative in some form or don’t have a clear definition of “completed.” I augment the end of the task title with “(Delete when complete)” so I know to delete the task instead of check it off when I’m done with it. That will keep it from repeating when it’s done and allow the project to move on.</p>

<p><strong>x5tom = “5am tomorrow”</strong></p>

<p>Occasionally, I need to push a task off until tomorrow. When I do, I use this in the Defer Date field to push it out one day. I could hit the “+1 day” button but this is habit.</p>

<p>Overall, this is extremely basic compared to what is possible. But this does all I need,  there’s no point overcomplicating it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/my-current-home-screen.png" /><p>When I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-overwhelm-inbox/">consolidated a handful of my inboxes</a> into my email it made me rethink my home screen. I had previously kept it slim but this takes it a step further and creates significant resistance to activities better left undone.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The biggest time wasters on my phone and the ones I have consolidated are social media, RSS feeds, and email. Once those were all funneled into email, they didn’t need to be on my phone at all. That meant Feedly, Google+, Pinterest, and LinkedIn all disappeared.</p>

<p>The big one here was Feedly. I normally used it as a triage tool, sending articles I wanted to read to Pocket. But I’ve always disliked their need to auto-shorten links when I share an article. It was bad enough that I built <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/workflow-to-share-articles-with-twitter-handle/">Workflow actions to overcome it</a>. The main reason I originally used Pocket was the IFTTT integration. This inbox consolidation process made me comb through my recipes and realize I wasn’t using IFTTT with Pocket anymore. I had slowly turned off all the connections with it. Goodbye, Pocket. Hello, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>. I’ve wanted to switch for a while anyway.</p>

<p>Once I deleted a few apps, I started thinking through how I use my phone. If the app isn’t on the front screen, I swipe down and search for it. If I’m going to launch apps with Spotlight, why keep multiple folders of them? I combined them into a single folder in order to bury the apps that are most tempting, but still keep them around for their Share Sheet functions. These are primarily Twitter and Instagram.</p>

<p>I’ve been using my phone this way for about a month now and it has seriously helped me limit my phone usage. It’s geared toward getting work done as opposed to blowing time. If I’m going to blow time, I’m <a href="http://bookworm.fm">better off reading</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/introducing-working-with-ideas.jpeg" /><p>Our ability to come up with ideas is like a muscle. If we work on it and develop the right habits, we get stronger and have more options available to us. But it’s difficult to build muscle if you don’t understand “how” the muscle works and the mechanics behind its improvement. Getting ideas is challenging until you learn what they are and how they work.

<p>That’s what <a href="https://workingwithideas.co/"><em>Working With Ideas</em></a> is all about: how do you create an idea and what do you do once you have it?  And I’m excited to say <a href="https://workingwithideas.co/"><em>Working With Ideas is now open</em></a>!</p>

<p>For two weeks, the course will be $25 off its regular price, so get in early to take advantage of the launch price. You can learn more and get a free sample by <a href="https://workingwithideas.co/">going to the course homepage</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/mindsets-before-tools.jpeg" /><p>Every time I come across an article that compares applications or declares an app to be the best at something, I cringe. Very few of them explain the scenarios necessary to make their conclusion valid.
<!--more--></p>

<p>We all operate differently, and we all have different skill sets and ways of thinking about the tools we use. We have varying needs and that means there is no absolute on the best tool for a task. This is why I always say, “I don’t know” when asked what task manager you should use. I have no clue what your circumstances are and what you need from a list manager.</p>

<p>This is precisely why many people (myself included) recommend using tools you already know when taking on a habit or system. It eliminates the need to learn a new tool and a new structure at the same time. But it’s more than that. The new structure will push you to develop a new mindset. Over time, you will begin to think about the items within your process in a more nuanced way as your ideas and rationale behind it progress.</p>

<p>Tools can get in the way of developing this nuanced thinking. You may start searching for an app to solve procrastination when you actually need to name your tasks differently. You need to understand yourself, how you operate, and what you need before deciding a new tool is the solution. And you can only take on a new tool successfully when you know what it offers that will suit your mindset. <em>That’s</em> when the articles comparing software are helpful.</p>

<p>It is only when you can sit down and spell out how a new tool will help that you understand your mindset well enough to warrant a potential change.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/bookwormlogo.png" /><p>Almost 2 months ago I embarked on a journey of reading a book every two weeks. Although there are a lot of personal benefits to doing this, it is primarily for a new podcast I’m doing with my good friend, <a href="http://mikeschmitz.me/">Mike Schmitz</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Mike and I have done a couple shows together in the past (<a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/057-joe-buhlig/">The Productivity Show</a> and <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/33/">Whaddya Know Joe</a>) and we each independently came to the conclusion that we wanted start a new show together. After a single call, Bookworm was born and recording commenced.</p>

<p>Bookworm is all about taking action on the words we read. Mike and I read a book, then talk about what it means for our lives. We can read all the books in the world but it’s for naught if we don’t do something with that knowledge.</p>

<p>Today we are revealing our work to the world. You can check it out it at <a href="http://bookworm.fm/">bookworm.fm</a> and find it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bookworm/id1132102092">on iTunes here</a>. We also have a Twitter handle for the show, <a href="https://twitter.com/bookwormfm">@bookwormfm</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a reader (or you’re not and want a summary), <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bookworm/id1132102092">subscribe now</a>. We’re super pumped about it and excited to talk books with you!</p>

Let’s change that.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>I did a lot of research on beginners microphones before I started podcasting and although there are better ones out there, I landed on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Podcaster</a>. I have a dream of upgrading to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Supercardioid-Condenser-Microphone-Applications/dp/B0002BACBO/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Beta 87</a> at some point, but this does a great job for now. Altogether here’s what I’m using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Podcaster</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/RODE-Swivel-Mount-Studio-Microphone/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Boom Stand</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-PSM-1-Shockmount-Podcaster/dp/B000WA8KYG/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Shockmount</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SM6-Shock-Mount-Integrated-Shield/dp/B004DE1K5S/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Popfilter</a></li>

</ul>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/my-podcasting-setup/rode-podcaster.jpeg" /></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I have been a subscriber to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> for a while now and really enjoy the power of their tools. They aren’t for everyone, but if you have access to it <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html">Audition CC</a> does a great job of editing and recording. When I’m recording with someone else, I use the traditional set of software that most podcasters use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html">Adobe Audition CC</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://mutemymic.com/">MuteMyMic</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/">Skype Call Recorder</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>In my opinion, the gold standard for hosting your files is <a href="https://www.libsyn.com/">Libsyn</a>. It just works and I’ve never had an issue with them. My feed is a custom XML file generated with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. If you are a Jekyll user and want to run a podcast, you can get the <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/Jekyll-Podcast-Feed">source code for this here</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/time-for-books.jpeg" /><p>In order to read a book every two weeks (and sometimes every week) I have had to make reading a practice that is incorporated throughout my day. Having a single time for reading isn’t enough and it has become a ritual I like to incorporate as many places as I can.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Each day is different, but I know I can count on a handful of repeated situations that allow me to read consistently.</p>

<h2 id="early-mornings">Early Mornings</h2>

<p>Every morning, I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">get up at five</a>, grab a shower, and make a hot breakfast for myself. This early breakfast always consists of two eggs fried in a cast iron skillet and a banana. While the skillet is warming up and the eggs are cooking, I read. When they are finished cooking, I read while I eat. This is easily the most reliable time I have for reading. It’s a relaxed, ritualistic, and energizing time that is perfect for creating motivation for the day ahead.</p>

<h2 id="transitions">Transitions</h2>

<p>Whether it’s a few extra minutes before a meeting or a quick break between tasks, the transitional periods throughout the day serve as excellent times to grab a book. It may only be a single page, but one page here and there can add up quickly. The beauty of reclaiming these transitional times comes from what it replaces: social media and email checks. Instead of losing 10 minutes to cruising Twitter, I finish a chapter in my book.</p>

<h2 id="waiting">Waiting</h2>

<p>I have started taking a book with me whenever I leave the house. I’m early to most meetings and often find myself waiting for others to show up. Having a book with me means I can get a few more pages read instead of perusing blog articles or email on my phone.</p>

<h2 id="eob-ritual">EOB Ritual</h2>

<p>At the end of my workday, I go through an End Of Business ritual that helps me unwind and clear my head for spending time with my family. I have tried various tactics during this time, but I have found that learning is the best at hitting the brakes on my mental race car. And what better way to learn than to read? So I’ve made it a habit of reading for about 15 minutes before calling it a day.</p>

<h2 id="bedtime">Bedtime</h2>

<p>The least reliable of my reading times is likely the most consistent for others. I am sporadic at reading before bed, but it is another time that is easy to take advantage of and turn a few pages in a book.</p>

<h2 id="the-pattern">The Pattern?</h2>

<p>When I reflect on each of these scenarios I notice a recurring theme. In every instance, I have historically focused my eyes on a screen instead of a book. It’s easy to check my phone for a few minutes before bed or while I am eating breakfast. But if I pay attention to how I feel afterwards, I always prefer the feeling of accomplishment after having read a book to the feeling of inadequacy that comes from checking a screen.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<p>I find these moments bittersweet. They often result in something much better, but they also bring with them an extensive amount of rework. This was precisely my experience when I took on my second book, <em>Working With Ideas</em>.</p>

<p>I was working on the outline and collecting segments of content when I realized the medium for this content and its delivery system was wrong. It needed to reveal more emotion and story with more camaraderie than an e-book can provide. So I changed direction and turned it into a full video course with a community of idea workers to share the experience with.</p>

<p>I consider this my best work and I’m thrilled to share it with you. I’m so excited about it that I decided to make it possible to <a href="http://pre.workingwithideas.co">get the course for free</a>! To get started, you simply need to <a href="http://pre.workingwithideas.co">sign-up for the launch email</a> (which gets you $12 off by itself).</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the course, you can check it out here: <a href="https://workingwithideas.co">workingwithideas.co</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[My friend,

We’ve come a long way since we met five years ago.

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/an-open-letter-to-productivity.jpeg" /><p>My friend,</p>

<p>We’ve come a long way since we met five years ago.<!--more--> And I cannot thank you enough for the clarity and direction you’ve given me through the multiple transitions and big decisions I have faced in recent years. Without the systems and tricks you’ve taught me, I would accomplish much less and fall short of numerous goals. For that, I am grateful.</p>

<p>I know I don’t always stick to the structure you’ve helped me build, but you’re always there when I realize I’ve stepped away. I know that if I trust the guidelines and follow them, my days are efficient and invigorating; and that makes me want to keep going and do more. It reveals my ability to do something great.</p>

<p>But sometimes I need space. I know you want me to be efficient with my calendar but there are periods when I need to blow some time with no expected outcomes. I need a little freedom. I need to be flexible and play once a while.</p>

<p>I think you would agree that margin is beneficial, but you often expect a measurable result when I take a break. I can understand that. We both know that taking time to re-energize can lead to greater gains elsewhere. But that’s my point: I can’t always look for the benefit of an activity. Why must everything have a defined positive outcome? Why not be content with the lack of definition and embrace spontaneity and play?</p>

<p>I want to continue our friendship, but with a different perspective. Let’s focus less on doing more and more on doing right. That likely means fewer projects, but I want them to be <em>better</em> projects. I know you’re with me here. But let’s also invite Play to our meetings. I’m aware of the love-hate relationship between you. Let’s work through that together. Between the three of us, I believe we can accomplish something awesome.</p>

<p>I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>Joe</p>
