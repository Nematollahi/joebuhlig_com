        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/An-alternative-to-Evernote.jpg" /><p>I’ve been a supporter of Evernote for a long time. I’ve written a number of articles on it and convinced a number of friends and family to start using it. But I’ve run into some issues with it and it’s come time to throw in the towel. I’m leaving Evernote.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="why-leave-evernote">Why leave Evernote?</h2>

<p>It’s proprietary. There are a lot of ways this <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/21/">becomes an issue</a> in my daily workflows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I capture ideas in Drafts and want to move that text to an article I’m writing. I can’t easily get it into Evernote without a copy/paste in some form.</li>
  <li>Uploading files to Evernote creates a mess when you want to edit them. This is primarily an issue on iOS. You have to monkey around with sharing the file to and from other apps to make it work and it usually creates new problems somewhere.</li>
  <li>I write in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> and want to convert it to html. There is zero support for markdown in Evernote.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on, but I think you get the point. If you’re good with their format and like using the Evernote apps for editing everything, it’s great. But the moment you need to share the information with a non-Evernote user or edit it with something outside Evernote, the mess quickly grows.</p>

<p>I understand there is a <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2015/07/20/meet-evernotes-next-ceo-chris-oneill/">new sheriff at Evernote</a>, but if I want to have the freedom to use any app I want with the information I’m storing, I need to step away. I’m sure there are good things coming with the change in leadership and I genuinely hope it works out for them. I know a lot of people that rely on and love their service.</p>

<h2 id="the-new">The New</h2>

<p>I looked into a number of alternatives to Evernote. <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/">DEVONThink</a> led the pack with its standard file database on the backend. But no matter which of these “all-in-one” solutions I looked at, they all either have a proprietary file format or they require (or highly recommend) you to use their own apps to work with your data. Neither of those requirements are something I’m willing to meet.</p>

<p>I’m ultimately looking for a way to access standard files from any app I choose. In the current app world, that means the information needs to be stored in raw text, images, or PDFs. In order for these files to be used by almost any app I choose, it needs to use DropBox as a backend. With those two criteria in place, it was pretty easy to whittle this down to a simple folder structure in DropBox.</p>

<p>I should note that I wanted this alternative to be something that is easy for others to use as well. I could build a new proprietary system or one that uses shell scripts and such, but that’s not easily picked up by folks who aren’t interested in scripting their Mac. I wanted this to be accessible.</p>

<h2 id="the-structure">The Structure</h2>

<p>The base of the system is a folder structure in DropBox. The folder that I use as an inbox becomes the center point for collection. This is identical to my methods in Evernote. It’s called <em>!nbox</em>. Unless it has a preprocessed location, information goes here for organizing later.</p>

<p>After the inbox, I treat the remainder of my folder structure much like I would my tags from Evernote. Client projects have a dedicated folder under <em>Clients</em>. Each podcast episode has its own folder under <em>Podcasts</em>. This isn’t complicated.</p>

<p>The one grouping that gets special treatment is <em>Writing</em>. I keep a folder for all my writing (articles, podcast scripts, book chapters, website alterations) which is linked to Editorial to make writing from my phone easier. This is also linked to a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/writing-with-github/">local git repository</a> on my Mac which allows me to review changes from my editor.</p>

<p>The base file formats I’m working with are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Text files</li>
  <li>Markdown files</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>PDFs</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s pretty easy to find apps (no matter your OS) that will work with these file types, and their broad use means new apps are always being created to pair with them. Just look at <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/">Brett Terpstra’s iTextEditors</a> to see how many options you have on iOS for editing text files. There’s a bunch, and they keep coming.</p>

<h2 id="capturing">Capturing</h2>

<p>Storing and working with the files is the easy part. Collecting things is where Evernote shines. It can be dead simple to get stuff into it, but once you step away from features like the Web Clipper, it gets more difficult. In this new setup, installing and using the DropBox app on all my devices eliminates most of the friction.</p>

<p>There are three main types of information I find myself capturing:</p>

<h3 id="web-pages">1. Web Pages</h3>

<p>Sometimes I want to come back to a website because it’s interesting; sometimes the design of the site intrigues me; other times I’m just gathering a bunch of research for a project. In all cases, I need to be able to save the webpage for later and I need to be able to do it from the Mac <em>and</em> iOS.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple on the Mac. There is a menu item called “Export as PDF…” under the File menu. You can <a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-set-up-custom-keyboard-shortcuts-on-your-mac--mac-176">map this to a keyboard shortcut</a> (look at step 5) to make it faster to access. In my testing, these PDFs are full-text searchable as well.</p>

<p>From iOS, I was a bit stumped on this. I was trying to use Workflow to pull it off and kept thinking about ways to convert html to a PDF. But I couldn’t get it to work right, and it seemed jumbled. Eventually I took a step back to think (which is what I usually need to do when things start looking muddled) and deduced that I simply wanted a way to share a PDF to DropBox. Then I remembered the “Save to DropBox” button in the Share Sheet. Hold on to your hats: It turns out that <em>this will convert the web page to a searchable PDF for you.</em> I was pretty darn excited to figure that out.</p>

<h3 id="images">2. Images</h3>

<p>Most pictures I collect are done through my phone. I used to send pictures to my Mac using AirDrop and then move them to DropBox later. But when I discovered the “Save to DropBox” trick, those issues were gone. It saves an image directly to DropBox.</p>

<p>If I do take a screenshot with my Mac, I save it to the inbox or put it where it belongs right away, depending on what I’m doing. Working with images on the Mac in this way isn’t much different than how I was using Evernote. They simply land in a new place.</p>

<h3 id="text">3. Text</h3>

<p>If I’m grabbing a quick note on something, it starts in nvALT (which is synced with DropBox). If it’s an article or something longer, it goes into a Sublime Text project (also synced with DropBox). In either case, I can access the text from my phone in Editorial.</p>

<p>When I think of an idea or a paragraph I want to add to an article and I’m away from my Mac, I start in Drafts. I always start there, sometimes it stays there for a while. When it’s time for the text to leave, I can create new text files out of it or send it to another app. There are too many options for what you can do with it from Drafts to spell them all out now. Again, options are gold, and I can do pretty much anything I want from here.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-end">In The End</h2>

<p>I still have a lot of work to do pulling 14,000 notes from Evernote. I’m looking for ways to export the data and move it over, but for now I’m happy with where I’m putting all the new. It gets me away from a proprietary format and makes it a whole lot easier to use the apps I enjoy.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/How-to-Create-Energizing-Rituals.jpg" /><p>I learned about creating rituals after I read <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/power-full-engagement-book-review/">The Power of Full Engagement</a> over a year ago. Since that time I’ve been figuring a few things out about building and implementing energizing rituals.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="what-and-why">What and why?</h2>

<p>We’ve talked about the difference between <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/routine-vs-ritual/">ritual and routine</a> before, but the gist is that a routine is similar to a checklist that you go through each day and a ritual is a series of steps you take (just like a routine) that you find energizing or bring you enjoyment. This is an important distinction to make when you start learning to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/power-full-engagement-book-review/">manage your energy levels</a> instead of your time.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever achieved more in a day than you did the entire previous week, you know what I mean by energy levels. Sometimes we naturally feel super energized and get a lot done. Then we all have “those days,” when just checking email feels daunting. When you build energizing rituals into your day, you can start to manufacture those moments of flow; but they aren’t always simple to create.</p>

<h2 id="finding-energizing-activities">Finding energizing activities</h2>

<p>What are your favorite topics to bring up with friends? What are the little things that you like doing or using but can’t explain why? What time of day do you look forward to?</p>

<p>I have a thing for fountain pens. I just like the way they write and that they’re different. I like the quality of the pens I use and look for excuses to write things down when I have them around.</p>

<p>Building things with my hands has always been a joy for me. After working on the computer throughout the day, I love the creative process of turning a piece of raw material into something useful.</p>

<p>I’m also a fan of the outdoors. Anytime I go outside to tackle the elements, I come back with a sense of accomplishment and pride.</p>

<p>I tell you these to give you ideas. The first step of building these rituals is understanding yourself and what you like to do. I bet you can nail these down pretty quickly if you stop for a couple minutes and think about it. Or if you have a spouse or close friend, ask them. There’s a good chance they can tell you what you love to do faster than you can. They have a different perspective that gives them a clearer view.</p>

<h2 id="converting-routines">Converting routines</h2>

<p>Whether you realize it or not, you use routines every day. You get up in the morning and get ready for work. You get ready for bed at night. Maybe you have a routine of daily journaling or playing with your kids after work. In any case, most have at least a few instances when they do something similar every day. These are the routines in your life.</p>

<p>You’ll have to decide which ones to convert (more on that in a moment), but the idea is to take an already existing routine and turn a piece of it into a ritual by injecting one of those energizing activities into it.</p>

<p>I have a routine that I run through at the end of my work day to plan for tomorrow. Recently, I started to do this plan on paper using my fountain pens. I enjoy using them and it takes a small neutral task and transforms it into an energizing one.</p>

<p>As a family, we enjoy spending time together when I get off of work. In the summer, we often take long walks with the girls. It’s a chance for me to get outside, get some exercise, and have a great conversation.</p>

<p>In both of these scenarios, I’ve been able to take something that I’m already doing and inject something into it. It makes them more fulfilling and gives me energy for whatever comes next in the day.</p>

<h2 id="which-routines">Which routines?</h2>

<p>The big question here is which routines do I try to convert? You don’t want to do this for everything or you’ll run out of time in the day and likely be way too energetic. We all know that guy who is way over the top and needs to settle down. Don’t be that guy.</p>

<p>Here’s the question to ask yourself: what times in the day do I feel like watching YouTube? It’s at least a good test for me. I know that if the only thing I want to do is stop and blow a few hours cruising YouTube, it’s a good time for me to stop and do something energizing. It can be simple, like checking in at the <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">discussion site</a> or it can be bigger, like taking 20 minutes to grab a snack with my family. No matter which energizing activity you decide to do, do it at a time when you need to increase your energy.</p>

<p>One word of caution: don’t do more than one at a time. Introduce a single ritual and stick with it until it’s second nature. Just like habits, if you try to take on more than one at a time, they’ll be overwhelming and have a negative effect instead of a positive.</p>

<p>In the end, you’re looking for things to do every day that will give you the energy to be more engaged with the people you see and the work you accomplish.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="the-budget-flaw">The Budget Flaw</h2>

<p>This is one of the flaws that most budgets face because they are weekly or monthly. But the timing doesn’t align with all the bills and wreaks havoc on the plan when you least expect it. Some bills come in monthly. Others come in annually or quarterly. But you normally won’t have an increase in income at the same time you have an unexpected or unplanned increase in expenses. It would be nice if it worked that way, but it’s wishful thinking.</p>

<h2 id="designated-funds">Designated Funds</h2>

<p>What if you had a fund set aside to pull from when these bills come in? You sometimes see these in company budgets: <em>designated funds</em>. They know that they’ll need to replace their employee computers some time in the future so they set aside dollars to pay for it when the need comes. This is exactly what we do to handle these abnormal bills.</p>

<p>I used to kick and scream about this because it cut into my <em>fun money</em> in a month, but I have to admit that it really helps stress levels. All that’s needed is some way to calculate and keep track of the allocated dollars in your budget. Create a separate fund for each of these bills and calculate how much you would pay if the bill was actually monthly (or weekly, depending on your budgeting period). That’s how much you need to pay yourself each period. When the bill comes in, just transfer the money you need into your budget for the month (increasing your income) and pay it. No stress involved.</p>

<h2 id="the-savings-tab">The Savings Tab</h2>

<p>I talked about this in the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/time-and-dollars/">Time &amp; Dollars article</a>. There are items for my business that I know I will need to replace in the future. I want to upgrade my phone and computer regularly, so I need to put money into those designated funds in my budget. For the business budget, I’ve created a tab called Savings in the spreadsheet to handle everything for me (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kDUSdsIKvtUnXxd4z9hgBQMUiht1oq_p6Iixl6dTyCU">see example budget</a>). It takes the amount of savings I have for the month, allows me to allocate it to each fund, and shows each fund’s balance.</p>

<p>The end goal here is to plan for these supposedly “unexpected” expenses. They aren’t truly unexpected when I know how much they will cost ahead of time and when they will be due. As long as I plan and save ahead, stress doesn’t have to enter the equation.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/The-Importance-of-Data-Visualization.jpg" /><p>It’s easy to present data in a summarized table, but what about turning it into a data visualization?
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>Data visualization is the display of data in a picture. Its purpose is to give a clear and easily understood visual of what the data is saying. Understanding the story in a data set by looking at spreadsheets and raw data isn’t something most people are accustomed to or good at, so we rely on a visualized format of the data, typically a graph or chart,  to help us.</p>

<h2 id="false-perceptions">False Perceptions</h2>

<p>It is critical to do this well or we risk giving the viewer an <a href="http://data.heapanalytics.com/how-to-lie-with-data-visualization/">incorrect perception</a> of the story behind the data. The display should show what is going on behind the scenes and the focus should be the data, not your interpretation of the data. Following conventional graphing methods will make it easier for your viewer to understand it. If you ignore these conventions, you risk building a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/bad-bar-charts/">bad bar chart</a> and deceiving your audience. You can get away with this if you do it subtly, but you’re sacrificing your integrity in the process and it will eventually come around to bite you.</p>

<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>

<p>When the visualization is done right, it explains what is happening. It’s impossible to look through millions of data points and know how things turned out. We can do summaries of the data to help, but oftentimes the summaries are even too complicated. People are visual by nature so a picture helps us see what is going on and interpret the results more clearly.</p>

<h2 id="patterns-and-outliers">Patterns and Outliers</h2>

<p>When you take the time to pull together this picture, you might be surprised at the patterns that start to reveal themselves. There are times when you may not realize you have patterns in your data until you put it in picture form. There are also times when the visual helps you see something that stands out. Just like the unknown patterns, you may not be aware of an outstanding data point until you graph it.</p>

<p>Take the time to build a good display of data. You want it to tell an accurate story and paint a picture of what is really going on. And it may show you something you didn’t know before.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Time-and-dollars.jpg" /><p>When I started my business, I wasn’t in a place to say no to anything. I needed to provide an income, and every little bit helped. But recently I’ve had to start deciding which activities are most worth my time and which ones need to be put aside.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This isn’t a decision I can make by sitting in front of a fire drinking coffee. As much as I like coffee, it’s not <em>that</em> good. I need some numbers to reveal the biggest (and smallest) returns on my time. I started <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro/">tracking my time</a>, but I need to dig deeper than that.</p>

<h2 id="budget">Budget</h2>

<p>Every good business has a budget. And mine, H&amp;A Tech, is no different. Without it, I don’t know if I’m making money or losing money. This simple document has a line for income and separate lines for each type of expense I incur. At the beginning of each month I plan the expenses and expected income for the month, and I do what I can to stick to it. Any deviation can create issues for my family later.</p>

<p>This is pretty standard, but it deviates from the norm when I pull in transactional data. I have a second tab that accepts copy-pasted transactions from my bank. Once a month I pull in this data and then augment each line item with a client and activity. It sounds tedious, but with the help of a few filters similar transactions can be filled in simultaneously.</p>

<p>Because I’m correlating the transactional data with the budget categories, I can see a clear summary of each month. How well did I stick to the plan?</p>

<p>Then I have savings. With an online business comes subscriptions and those often have annual payments. I handle those with a savings tab in the spreadsheet, but that’s a topic for another day.</p>

<h2 id="google-sheet">Google Sheet</h2>

<p>This might be a bit hard to get your head around so I put together an example budget for you to look through. I keep my budget in a Google Sheet so I made a copy and cleared it out for you to see. Here are the tabs you’ll find in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kDUSdsIKvtUnXxd4z9hgBQMUiht1oq_p6Iixl6dTyCU">the example</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Budget - the plan for the month (includes the summary)</li>
  <li>Transactions - the bank transactional data</li>
  <li>Savings - long term expenses and savings funds</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="from-budget-to-time-tracker">From Budget to Time Tracker</h2>

<p>The budget is in place and the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro/">time tracker</a> is tracking away. So I created a new tab in the time tracker to import the transactional data from the budget. With the data pulled over, I group the time and transactions by month, client, and activity using pivot tables. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Time and Dollars/time-aggregation.jpg" /></p>

<p>With the datasets each grouped in the same way, they can now be tied together into a single table. I do this with the SUMPRODUCT function as <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2012/04/26/using-multiple-criteria-in-excel-lookup-formulas/">explained here</a> which makes it a one-step process. Once the data is all in one place, I can run another pivot table to figure out where my time is most valuable.</p>

<h2 id="by-client">By Client</h2>

<p>Is my time better spent on my own projects or working for my clients? And the follow-up question: which clients give me the best return on my time? If I have a client that requires a lot of support and effort but there isn’t much for income to compensate, I either need to raise my rates or consider letting them go. It’s difficult to know about these situations without data. Once I have the information, I can make my decision with confidence.</p>

<h2 id="by-activity">By Activity</h2>

<p>The other segmentation I need to understand is the activity breakdown. What type of work has the highest monetary value? I ask this because I’m not sure if my return is higher when I write for myself or when I consult a client. By switching the pivot table to group by activity, I can see which types of work give me the highest returns and which ones I should consider scaling back.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Setting this up can be labor-intensive, but I hope you see the value here. Working for yourself can bring a lot of opportunities your way, and knowing which ones to take on and which to pass by can be tricky. This process gives you real numbers to work with and makes it less of a guessing game.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro.jpg" /><p>Lately I’ve been tracking my time and starting to correlate it with dollars earned. The idea is to help me decide which types of work are the most valuable. This is a look at how I’m doing the time tracking portion using <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="google-sheet">1. Google Sheet</h2>

<p>The data needs to live somewhere and I’m comfortable with Google Drive. So I created a new sheet with five columns:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>DateTime</strong> - Timestamp of when it was recorded.</li>
  <li><strong>Client</strong> - Who is the activity for? This is mostly “Joe Buhlig.”</li>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong> - Writing an article, recording a podcast, coding, etc…</li>
  <li><strong>Amount</strong> - How long was I doing the activity?</li>
  <li><strong>Notes</strong> - Any notes I have about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this format I can do roll-ups by client or by activity. It allows me to compare the time I spend on a client and the gross income from that client to determine my hourly rate. This makes it easy to know if my rates are where they should be.</p>

<p>It also helps me determine the types of work that are the highest paying. Doing a similar roll-up by activity will tell me if my time is better spent coding or consulting. But I have to be careful, because the answers can be a bit misleading. Writing articles for this site shows a zero for profit, but I know that writing is what brings people to my site. And in turn, that leads to sales elsewhere. So my conclusions are a judgment call, but it is helpful to have the data in front of me.</p>

<h2 id="ifttt">2. IFTTT</h2>

<p>To collect the data I’m using a single recipe in <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>. It adds a row to the Google Sheet each time the LCP action is triggered. By passing different parameters to the recipe, I alter the data that is entered into the spreadsheet.</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/375147-time-tracking" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_13" id="embed_recipe-375147"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/375147" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Time Tracking connects launch-center to google-drive" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<h2 id="launch-center-pro">3. Launch Center Pro</h2>

<p>In LCP, I set up a different action for each activity I want to record. Each action uses the same url scheme to send the data on to Google. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">launch://ifttt/trigger?name=&amp;value1=&amp;value2=&amp;value3=[prompt-num:Time in Mins]&amp;value4=[prompt:Notes]</code></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> parameter will always be the same: the Trigger Name in the IFTTT recipe. In this case, I’m passing my own name as <code class="highlighter-rouge">value1</code> because this particular action is for recording development work I do for myself. The last three values record the activity type, amount of time I spent on the task, and any notes I want to enter about it.</p>

<h2 id="in-practice">In Practice</h2>

<p>Whenever I start a new task, I start a stopwatch. When I finish the task or need to move on to something else, I stop the watch, open LCP, and select the action for the task I was working on. I enter the time and any notes about it and I’m done. This creates a new record in the Google Sheet that I can use for analytics later.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve chosen Discourse as the engine behind the scenes. You can sign up at <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">discussion.joebuhlig.com</a>. To start, it will be really basic. My hope is that it will evolve into a community that can help each other out with tech and productivity questions and tips. Here are the categories I’m kicking it off with.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>This replaces the subreddit that I’ve been using. Each post will have a dedicated topic with replies embedded at the bottom of the post. This makes it possible to continually add to posts and see responses to the most popular questions without going to a different site.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-omnifocus">Working with OmniFocus</h2>

<p>This is a dedicated category for <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">the book</a>. Any questions about it or ideas for the next version go here.</p>

<h2 id="off-topic">Off Topic</h2>

<p>The majority of this site is based on technology and productivity, but sometimes I’d like to discuss interesting articles and topics that don’t really apply. This is where I’ll post them.</p>

<h2 id="meta">Meta</h2>

<p>This is a discussion about the discussion itself as well as this blog. If you have topic ideas or suggestions for how to improve the site or discussion, I’d love to see them here.</p>

<p>I am excited about building a community where we can help each other learn and grow. Come <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">check it out</a>!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Just-a-Laptop.jpg" /><p>When I started my business I made the shift from three 27” monitors to just a laptop screen. That shift has taught me a few things about how I work.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="different-modes">Different Modes</h2>

<p>I have different mindsets and needs when I’m doing different types of work. I can listen to upbeat music and kick back on the couch when I’m cycling through email, but I need instrumental, low-key music and my desk when I’m coding. These two examples were the extremes that made me start to pay attention.</p>

<p>Noticing those subtle differences has brought some pretty big gains in productivity. I used to rarely leave my desk because the monitors made it possible to see so much at once. When I only have the laptop screen it forces me to focus and choose the best (or most comfortable) environment.</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>Forcing focus has paid big dividends in my writing. Because I don’t have the ability to see a whole bunch of things at once, I stick to the task in front of me. Since the time I’m most vulnerable to YouTube binges is when I sit down to write, this has paid off. I usually enjoy the process of writing but getting started is hard when there’s a Twitter feed staring at me from the corner.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>One area that has suffered is coding. It’s not uncommon for me to have three browsers open, multiple instances of Sublime Text, and multiple terminal windows running all at once. The ease of seeing a bunch of those at once is extremely helpful and allows me to work much more quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>This isn’t my forever setup, but it is good for me to appreciate the advantages and acknowledge the limitations of working from “just a laptop.”</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Dictating-vs-Typing.jpg" /><p>Dictation is becoming more and more commonplace, and as the software behind it continues to get better we’ll likely see it become a bigger part of our daily lives.
<!--more--></p>

<p>It takes some practice, but once you understand the mechanics, dictating can increase your time efficiency. From texting to getting the latest Chiefs scores, there are endless uses for the technology. I use Siri a fair amount and now that “Hey Siri” is wireless in the iPhone 6S, I’ve found my use cases increasing.</p>

<p>Because of Siri’s current accuracy, I decided to dictate the first draft of <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a>. I knew that I could get the ideas out of my mind much faster if I were able to simply speak them.</p>

<p>It was great. I plugged in my podcasting mic, turned on dictation, and went to town. I could draft an entire chapter in about 90 minutes. In 6 days I had finished the entire first draft. It felt awesome to be able to do so much in so little time.</p>

<p>When I reflected on that process I realized that I spent a lot of time trying to find the specific words I wanted instead of working to get the ideas out of my head. I was able to input the words so quickly that I had a hard time coming up with the words I wanted. This by itself really isn’t a big deal, but it meant that I needed to find a way to pre-process my thoughts ahead of time.  In the end I spent an hour writing or typing my notes for each chapter before I dictated them, so there wasn’t much for time savings.</p>

<p>Since the dictation wasn’t 100% perfect, I spent quite a bit of time deciphering my original intent when editing. Not only was I trying to improve the sentences and paragraphs, but the words themselves were so far off at times that I couldn’t figure out what I was talking about and ended up rewriting the whole thing anyway.</p>

<p>More practice would likely improve my dictation, but the slower pace of typing gives me time to process my thoughts more clearly and reduce editing later. It helps me gain clarity faster and spend more time refining the ideas than the process. I will continue to use dictation for smaller chunks, but in my case anything long-form is better suited to typing.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/Mac-Navigation.jpg" /><p>Nerdy Mac users are known for customizing their machines. Between keyboard shortcuts, Spaces, and third-party apps, you can effectively set up a computer that is perfect for you and unusable by someone else.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But folks don’t typically think about how they move from one application to another. Mission Control or Spaces are the standard solutions. I’ve found that Spaces doesn’t work well because it forces me to pull my hands from the keyboard to the trackpad. And I can never find the app I want in Mission Control.</p>

<h2 id="hiding">Hiding</h2>

<p>I’ve developed a process of showing and hiding apps, making it possible to immediately switch to the app I want by hiding the one I was just using. I use the built in shortcut Command-H to hide an application from view. It doesn’t close the application, it just moves it to the background. I can get back to it in a couple ways, by using Spotlight or by clicking on the app icon in the dock.</p>

<h2 id="alfred">Alfred</h2>

<p>But I prefer to use my launcher of choice, <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, to bring it back. I can invoke Alfred, type the name of the application I want, and keep moving. To make it even faster, I set up a few shortcuts for commonly used programs so I can go directly to the app I want. For example, I can hit Control-Option-O to pull up OmniFocus. Control-Option-F will open Finder and Control-Option-T opens Sublime Text. They all start with Control-Option to make it easier to remember.</p>

<h2 id="in-practice">In Practice</h2>

<p>Anytime I need a different app, I either type the Alfred shortcut or type the name of the app into Alfred. When I’m done with it, I hide it or repeat the process to open the next one. Just remember to close them when you’re done or your computer will be as slow as a slug.</p>
