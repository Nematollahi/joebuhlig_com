        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/analog-writing-organization.jpeg" /><p>When I made the decision to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-science-and-experience-of-analog-writing/">embrace pen and paper</a>, the need for structure quickly showed its face. I wanted my writing to live in a single notebook, but that meant I needed a method of tracking progress on pieces without thumbing through the whole notebook.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The logical conclusion here is an index which allows me to see each composition and the headway I’ve made. That progression consists of three steps which need to be incorporated in the indicator. First is the initial draft: the dump of the ideas at the onset. Second is the editing process of the first draft, and the final step is to transcribe the writing to the computer for one last look. Once it is moved from paper to screen, the tracking process is handled digitally.</p>

<p>In practice, this means I need a list of articles augmented with the location within the notebook and the progress I’ve made on it. A simple page number will do for the location, but I wanted an evolving indicator for the progress meter. And since there are only three states to track, I went for the slow build of a star: “/” → “X” → “*”.</p>

<p>When there is no indicator, I know I have made a commitment to the piece but haven’t started writing. The “/” tells me I’ve finished the first draft. The “X” tells me the editing process as been completed. And the final “*” is a picture of completion when the transcription is finished. Altogether, this is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/analog-writing-organization/index.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Now, I can take the first few pages of any notebook to create this index over the life of the notebook. I could also add page numbers to any grouping of paper I feel inclined to use. Throw on top of this my want for good fountain pen paper and I was certain I would need to hack together a custom notebook or make compromises. But that’s not the case.</p>

<p>I found the notebook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=leuchtturm1917&amp;sprefix=leuchtturm1917%2Caps%2C166&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=joebuhlig-20">Leuchtturm</a>, that has all of these features plus a few I didn’t realize I wanted. They have a built-in index as well as page numbers. It’s high-quality paper and has dual bookmark ribbons, one for finding my index and one for the last used page. There’s even a slot in the back that acts as an inbox while I’m out and stickers to help with archiving the notebook. I haven’t made a decision about keeping these when I fill it, but having the ability to easily do so and knowing the quality of the notebook makes me consider long-term storage of my hand-written words. Though storage space will likely make my decision for me.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm-Master-Notebook-Hardcover-Dotted/dp/B003ENUIKC?tag=joebuhlig-20">Master Dot Grid</a> notebook because it’s larger and keeps my pages clean. The bigger pages allow me to see more of the piece at one time and requires less page turning when dictating the words into a microphone. It also fits nicely into the computer slot in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoon-Innovations-Backpack-Laptop-MCP3401BK/dp/B00LBYTMOY?tag=joebuhlig-20">backpack</a> which is perfect for writing ventures away from the house. I’m a big fan of the Dot Grid paper because it limits the markings on the page yet gives me a bit of structure to keep my words in line.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to write by hand and need an organizational structure for your writing, take a look at Leuchtturm. Their notebooks fit perfectly.</p>

<p>Note: this article contains affiliate links, but this is <strong>not a sponsored post</strong>. I’m simply a big fan of Leuchtturm and have found their products exceptional to use.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/the-overwhelm-inbox.jpeg" /><p>The purpose of my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/inbox-consolidation/">inbox consolidation project</a> is to cut back on the number of places I go to make decisions about my “open loops”. Between feeds, social media, and our always-on expectations, it becomes a habit and struggle to keep up with the mass of apps and information thrown at us. My theory was to create an aggregated inbox via email that combines these potentially overwhelming sources of inputs. The hope was to build a system that helps me scale back on the time and impulse to repeatedly process these inboxes.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Using email as a base for this is the simplest solution since it can be connected to almost any service out there. Most systems already have an email notification system built-in. By turning these on, I go from repeatedly checking websites to see if anything is new to processing the important parts at a dedicated time. But not every source of new information has this ability. For me, the outstanding inputs are RSS feeds and social media.</p>

<p>For social media, I had to first be honest with myself. What do I really <em>need</em> to know about? I know that I <em>want</em> to keep up with more than I should so I’m immediately faced with scaling back. For the inputs that make the cut, I use <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> to send me an email about each item. For example, I have a rule that emails me when I am mentioned on Twitter:</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/425773-send-twitter-mentions-to-email" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_30" id="embed_recipe-425773"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/425773" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Send Twitter mentions to email connects twitter to gmail" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<p>Another set of overwhelming inputs is the huge variety of articles that I want to read. It’s already a habit for me to send these to Pocket from any social media app or browser I’m using at the time. To funnel these from Pocket into my email, I’m again turning to IFTTT:</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/425768-send-all-pocket-articles-to-email" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_33" id="embed_recipe-425768"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/425768" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Send all Pocket articles to email connects pocket to gmail" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<p>Now for the big one: RSS feeds. You can set up recipes to send new feed items to your email with IFTTT. However, I am subscribed to about 100 RSS feeds. That would require 100 recipes to make it work. No, thank you. Instead, I found a service (<a href="http://feed.informer.com">feed.informer.com</a>) that allows me to create a single RSS feed out of multiple feeds. In my case, I created two of these “digest” feeds that I then used in these recipes, which is a lot more comfortable. This has the added benefit of eliminating an app, Feedly, that I was previously using.</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/425763-send-email-from-feed-digest" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_27" id="embed_recipe-425763"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/425763" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Send email from feed digest connects feed to gmail" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<p>Of course, it’s easy to see that this leads to a potentially enormous number of emails.  A fair amount of these can be deleted without opening them; I have everything I need to triage them in the subject line. But the key is to clear it out once daily. If I hold to that and avoid the temptation to check more often, I am given the freedom to spend more of my mental energy on important tasks. It also makes it easier to leave my phone somewhere other than my pocket or within reach at my desk.</p>

<p>The other, unintended, benefit of this has been visibility into the sheer volume of tiny bits of data that are available to us. We can easily consume thousands of pointless and potentially detrimental inputs that are better left unnoticed. Pulling all of these into one place provides a picture of information overwhelm that is catered specifically to you. I never realized how many sources of information I’ve tried to keep up with until now. It has led me to ruthlessly curate and cut back in ways I wish I had done sooner.</p>

<p>And as I expected, this is led me to change the purpose - and therefore layout - of my phone’s home screen for the better. But we’ll save that for another day:</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/editorial-as-a-database-viewer.jpeg" /><p>One habit that Evernote taught me was that of creating databases, collections of text and pictures that revolve around a specific topic or item. I’m yet to export my Evernote data into my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/an-alternative-to-evernote/">alternative storage system</a> but I have solved my most glaring issue: searching and viewing these databases on iOS.
<!--more--></p>

<p>These consist of three data types: text, documents, and pictures. All text is created in markdown files. The documents are primarily PDFs and the pictures are… well they’re pictures. All of these files have a very simple organizational structure in DropBox. There’s a folder named after the type of database (Drinks), a subfolder if necessary (Coffee), and then the files which are named after the item itself (Caribou Mahogany.jpg). If there are pictures, documents, <em>and</em> text for the same item, they’ll get the same name (but with different file extensions) to make it easy to search.</p>

<p>It’s a very basic structure, which makes it easy to find and interact with these different files from different apps on iOS. My app of choice for text files is <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a>. There’s a lot of power in Editorial that I’ve never utilized but I do know that it’s excellent for editing and reading markdown.</p>

<p>I was typing out a few sentences for an article while waiting for a friend when I accidentally tapped the name for a PDF within Editorial. To my surprise, I was given the ability to “Quick Look” the document within the app. I am not sure why I never tried this before but it singlehandedly changed my methods for interacting with these databases from a multi-app approach to a single point of access.</p>

<p>This means that given a file structure that works for you and a text-heavy implementation of databases, Editorial can act as a user interface similar to these catchall tools like Evernote. Yes, there is the downside of not being able to capture documents and pictures directly into Editorial. The trick is to capture these into DropBox and let Editorial be the viewer instead. But since my databases are primarily text, I’m able to leverage the power of a tool that was designed extensively for text and maintain the majority of my editing needs. Add to that the ability to view the extra files I compile and iOS now has a database interface I didn’t know I wanted.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/checklists-in-omnifocus.jpeg" /><p>Keeping different types of information in separate apps or systems is sometimes worth the extra infrastructure. But there is also a lot of value and mental freedom in using an existing process for multiple forms of data.
<!--more--></p>

<p>When you have a tool as flexible and powerful as OmniFocus, it gets easier to combine needs into one database. That is why I originally <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-omnifocus-for-somedaymaybe-lists/">moved my Someday/Maybe lists</a> into OmniFocus. The simplicity of having a single place for active <em>and</em> potential tasks eliminated a bit of resistance to capturing an idea. This ease was also my rationale for moving my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/recurring-checklists-in-evernote/">checklists from Evernote</a> to OmniFocus.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to keep checklists in OmniFocus, but I keep the process as effortless as possible. I manage a single folder that holds all of them. I don’t have so many that I feel the need to subdivide them. They are all together in one list and each checklist has the same settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parallel project set to “Complete when completing last action”</li>
  <li>Repeat set to Defer Again in one minute</li>
</ul>

<p>When I sit down to go through a checklist, I work from the project view so it doesn’t matter if the project is Parallel or Sequential. I see every item on the list regardless. My default for new projects is Parallel so I leave it alone. I want these to autocomplete and recreate themselves when everything is done; the repeat and completion settings make it happen.</p>

<p>I’ve used checklists for packing lists, payroll, and even rituals for quite a while. But during a recent Weekly Review I realized I was putting a handful of checklists elsewhere and treating them differently when I shouldn’t. The lists of steps for all my reviews has been living in my Guidance folder, so I flagged them to display on my Dashboard.</p>

<p>This is a prime example of how fluid a GTD system can be. It needs to fluctuate with how you work and morph as you learn about yourself. I very recently wrote about how I work with my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-omnifocus-dashboard/">OmniFocus Dashboard</a>. And here I am changing its purpose entirely. I realized I had abstracted and complicated these meta-lists unnecessarily. Yes, they are Guidance projects to complete at regular intervals, but those intervals are better placed on the calendar and the checklist put where they belong. By breaking them off into their own category, I was required to maintain another level of the structure. If I can simplify it and uphold my level of productivity while eliminating mental strain (no matter how small), why wouldn’t I reduce the complexity? This is especially true when the work required to pull it off is miniscule.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that I’ve moved my reviews into my checklists folder and pulled them from the Dashboard. I reserve time on my calendar for them and go through the list at that time. It cuts back on the automation going into my daily task list and gives me the freedom to put off a review for a few hours or days if I need to go heads down on a project. It also eliminates some of the overwhelm from seeing a Dashboard with 30+ items on it in the morning.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/inbox-consolidation.jpg" /><p>As part of a new project that will be released in a few weeks, I recently reread <em>Getting Things Done</em> by David Allen. I found it interesting that David hasn’t changed his tune when it comes to information overload. Despite a dramatic increase in technology and the volume of inputs as compared to the original writing, he still advocates for the same capture mechanisms and clarification process.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This is to be expected but reading his thoughts on the subject of social media struck a chord with me. I have long considered Twitter, piles on my desk, and the bench in my woodshop as inboxes. Developing an awareness of where “open loops” collect is a process that reveals a large number of inboxes we may not realize we have. And when we consider the number of apps we use that have an “in” feature, this number can explode. Unless we do something about it we’ll spend all our time clearing our trays, and as soon as we get through them once, we’ll need to start over again. The easy and obvious solution here is to cut back on inputs and create “aggregate inboxes” or places that pull captured items from multiple sources.</p>

<p>Cutting back is the best alternative here, but often times we can’t do this or don’t want to. So the next option is to create consolidated inboxes. I like to think of these as smart inboxes. We may not be able to pull everything into a single inbox but the fewer places that need cleared, the better.</p>

<p>And to be honest, I don’t want everything in one inbox. And I don’t need to process all my inboxes at the same intervals. My voice mails need cleared out multiple times a day, but that pile on the bench in my woodshop only needs clearing when I want to make sawdust. That means my aggregate inboxes can’t be consolidated beyond my clarification frequencies.</p>

<p>Let’s take email for example. Like most, I have multiple email addresses. Whenever I process email (which is way too often), I prefer to take care of all my emails at once. So I pull everything into a single, master email account on Gmail. That allows me to see every new email and act on it from one place.</p>

<p>On my phone, I group all social media accounts into a single folder. I can check them all at once (again, too often) instead of bouncing in and out of them individually. It can become a check pit if I don’t group them.</p>

<p>Although I have done some of this aggregation already, I’m now trying to further the automated consolidation and looking for ways to cut back on physical inboxes. The easier of these are the physical inboxes. I need to notice and combine them to cut back on the number of collection points. The digital side is more treacherous. It’s too easy to draw the conclusion of auto-forwarding all emails or Twitter mentions into OmniFocus. If you’re a social media manager, that might be a good idea. But as a writer and developer, that would be detrimental to my daily work. I would quickly develop a habit of clearing my OmniFocus inbox every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The better solution might be my existing email account. If I’m already strictly limiting my time in email, that could easily be a better place to send these inputs. And if I can craft the format of the email in a way that enables a quick decision or even an automated decision then my information overwhelm can slowly dissipate. At least, that is the hope.</p>

<p>So the idea here is to bring all digital inputs created by someone other than myself into my email. That sounds a bit scary at first, but if that single inbox can help me cut back on the growing number of digital places to clear, allow me to remain on top of those inputs, and limit the mental strain of multiple collection points, I have succeeded.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/intentional-gtd-titles.jpeg" /><p>When I started with GTD five years ago, I was certain it was the missing piece to my mental overwhelm puzzle. It was the five-step framework that would keep me from procrastinating and give me the motivation to accomplish everything to which I kept saying yes.
<!--more--></p>

<p>And although these are possible outcomes, they are far from implicit. GTD can help you stay on task and give you the means to work on the right next action, but not without your discipline and persistence. And then it only works if you do all of the thinking about a task or project when it is initially processed. Take these projects for example:</p>

<p><strong>Wife’s birthday</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Cake</li>
  <li>Present</li>
  <li>Plates and silverware</li>
  <li>Invite friends</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>example.com</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete web design</li>
  <li>Decide on host</li>
  <li>Email?</li>
  <li>Launch date?</li>
  <li>Commerce section</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New product</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Photos for website</li>
  <li>Quality across lines</li>
  <li>Market?</li>
  <li>Retailers</li>
  <li>Press release</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, these may seem fine. I have a list of projects and a list of tasks that go with each project. But you may see a glaring issue here; there’s still some interpretation necessary to decide what each requires you to do. Is “plates and silverware” a reminder to set the table or is it part of your shopping list? Are you asking about the addition of email addresses to the website or the set up for an email newsletter? Does “press release” mean you need to write it, publish it, or review it? Granted, some of the detail missing here may be implied depending on the context assigned to each. If “plates and silverware” has the @Errands context, you have your answer.</p>

<p>But the projects themselves leave you in question as well. Do you have a shopping list for your wife’s birthday or a list of setup that needs to happen on the day itself? Are you writing the code for the website or overseeing the project? Are you exploring the addition of a new product for your company or is it a new thing you’re exploring personally? Again, some of this may be implied through the metadata you assigned but the title itself is still lacking. This set of projects leaves a lot of questions and requires you to decode a series of assumptions before you can take action.</p>

<p>Part of the <em>why</em> of GTD is to eliminate the need to hold information in our minds since we are terrible at recalling it when we need it. But we inevitably develop a need to remember our intent for these projects and tasks if we treat them as nothing more than a list of triggers. We’ve left ourselves with only half of the thinking completed and retain the other half in our minds, which defeats the goal we originally set out to achieve. We better serve ourselves if we finish the process and put all of the data we need or have for the item in the name.</p>

<p>That naturally begs the question, “how <em>should</em> you name them?”” The answer is simple in principle and challenging in practice. These titles should tell you exactly what needs to be done without the need to augment it with information you are still trying to remember. From a tactical standpoint, that means starting with a verb and giving so much detail that you can wake up in the middle of the night and still know what to do when you read it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wife’s birthday → <em>Celebrate wife’s birthday at home</em></li>
  <li>example.com → <em>Build example.com for client xyz</em></li>
  <li>New product → <em>Launch new line of sweatshirts</em></li>
</ul>

<p>By renaming these projects, you instantly see an increase in clarity and you know what <em>done</em> is just by reading the title. It takes more work up front to give this level of definition, but I can tell you from experience that those extra few seconds will save you the time and hassle of rethinking them each time in the future.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cake → <em>Call Deli re: custom cake for wife’s birthday party</em></li>
  <li>Email? → <em>Email client xyz re: how many email accounts are needed prior to launch?</em></li>
  <li>Press release → <em>Write first draft of online press release for new line of sweatshirts</em></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s no small task to spell out this much detail, but the benefits are invaluable. Instead of seeing a few words that require interpretation (which becomes a task itself), I see an action to be taken. Eliminating that miniscule amount of resistance can be the difference between productive work and procrastination. Don’t let a desire to save time up front create an excuse to do nothing later.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/the-science-and-experience-of-analog-writing.jpeg" /><p>I began <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/writing-articles-by-hand/">hand writing articles</a> with a lot of skepticism mixed with hope. I didn’t know what to expect but I wanted a positive outcome. As much as I lean toward an integration of technology in every aspect of my work, I felt a sense that paper had benefits I had never understood.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I committed to writing five articles by hand, but after the first three I realized there was something powerful happening during the process of putting words on physical paper. It was like I had discovered a well of untapped resources within my mind that could only be used when analog tools were the chosen medium. And no matter how much I reflected and searched myself for the reasoning behind this, I couldn’t find the answer without searching for neurological science comparing pen and paper to the keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="brain-organization">Brain Organization</h2>

<p>I learned that it all starts with how our brains organize modes of thinking. It’s common knowledge that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere">two hemispheres</a> in our brains and that they operate in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain#Lateralization">transposed manner</a>. The left brain controls the right side of the body and the right brain controls the left side of the body. We also know that modes of thinking occur on one side or the other. The left brain is known as the analytical brain because it controls the mathematical, logical, and scientific modes of thinking while the right brain - known as the creative brain - controls creativity, music, and imagination. The skills required to write (language, speech, and linear thinking) are found in the left brain.</p>

<h2 id="brain-dominance">Brain Dominance</h2>

<p>Each of us has one side of our brain that is more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function">dominant</a> than the other. And the level of dominance is different for everyone. In part, this is why we find such a diversity of personalities and skill sets. Sometimes there’s a strong dominance, other times it’s hardly noticeable. Regardless of the level of dominance, this side of the brain reveals itself in your strengths. A left brain dominant person is likely to be a math whiz, analytical, and following a career in the sciences. Someone who is right brain dominant has a tendency to be good at relationships, art, and visualization. These are not hard rules, but guidelines and stereotypes. I’ve known that I’m an analytical person for a long time, which means I’m left brain dominant.</p>

<h2 id="hand-dominance">Hand Dominance</h2>

<p>With rare exception, we all primarily use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness">one hand</a> or the other to write. How we develop or choose a specific hand for this task is genetic, but has cultural influences as well. The whole picture of how this comes about is still unclear, but whichever hand you write with is typically your dominant hand. And for most of us (90%), that dominance is found in our right hand.</p>

<h2 id="dominance-correlation">Dominance Correlation</h2>

<p>Things get interesting when you correlate brain and hand dominance. Being left brain dominant does not make you right-handed. Nor does being right brain dominant make you left-handed. But when you are left-handed, the right brain is controlling your writing hand and vice versa. So left-handers are using the creative brain when writing and right-handers are using the analytical brain. And since we know that language, speech, and linear thinking come from the left (analytical) brain, right-handers, like myself, are naturally engaging the portion of their mind that allows them to formulate words and sentences.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is not to say that left-handers cannot write well. The brain is much more complex than that. But generally speaking, it might explain some of the stigma around teaching left-handed children to write. It’s possible that it doesn’t come as naturally to them as drawing or creating art.</p>

<h2 id="the-keyboard">The Keyboard</h2>

<p>The physical process of typing is much different than using a pen. Writing on paper is primarily a one-handed task. Your off hand may be busy keeping paper aligned or holding a pen cap, but the main work is being completed with one hand. Contrast that with the keyboard. The keyboard is designed for both hands, which is partially why it’s much faster to type than write.</p>

<p>By using both hands to type, we engage both sides of our brain more fully. That is not altogether a bad thing, but it does mean that we aren’t focusing on one mode of thinking. We’re switching from linear, language thinking to spatial, emotional thinking and back again. Some people are better with this dissonance than others, which is why some say there is no difference between typing and writing by hand. I personally struggle with this neurological bouncing during the writing process. But when I pick up a pen I can trace a thought and explore it without all the mental jumping around.</p>

<h2 id="studies">Studies</h2>

<p>There’s a growing body of science exploring the comparison between hand writing and typing. Researchers have shown that writing lecture notes by hand gives students an edge over their typing peers. We know that kids with and without handwriting disabilities are able to write more when using a pen than when using a computer. There’s even a study from 1987 that hints at a potential influence on writing when done from a computer. If you <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=pen+paper+writing+vs+computer">search Google Scholar</a> for “pen paper writing versus computer” you’ll have more than enough material to keep you busy for a while. But here are a few of the resources I found interesting when I began my exploration:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/writing-on-paper_n_5797506.html">The Benefits Of Writing With Good Old Fashioned Pen And Paper</a></p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>

<p>To say that I’ve enjoyed the process of writing by hand would be an understatement. Some of the benefits I was expecting did become a reality. By taking longer to write by hand I am able to formulate my thoughts more clearly and fully; I feel better about what I’ve written when I’m done. But going further than just quality of words, I’ve discovered a few other benefits and one glaring downside.</p>

<h3 id="distraction">Distraction</h3>

<p>As I expected, I’m not nearly as distracted with paper as I am with the computer. And it is primarily due to availability. Because it is so easy to take a quick peek at Twitter, I don’t stay on task nearly as well on the computer. Pen and paper affords me only one thing to do: put words on a page. It naturally allows me to focus on the task at hand.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Previously I had to put tricks in place to bring myself to write. I’ve always enjoyed the accomplishment of having written, but the process itself has always felt like a burden. I had to write in the morning, my most alert time of the day, to focus enough to write. It was the only way to get it done. But when I started exploring analog writing, I discovered an innate interest in pulling out the paper. Most of the tricks and timing are unnecessary. There’s joy in inking a fountain pen, opening a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm-Master-Notebook-Hardcover-Dotted/dp/B003ENUIKC?tag=joebuhlig-20">quality notebook</a>, and laying words on the page that allows me to write more without it being a hardship.</p>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<p>Here’s the downside. It takes longer and that’s for two reasons. One, it takes longer to write by hand than it does to type. That comes with the positive of higher quality but it’s still a hit to the efficiency I had with typing. Second, I write longer articles when writing by hand. I spell out more detail and develop thoughts more fully. Again, I see this as a positive, but it means I need to be willing to cut time elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>I’ve always felt that writing was synonymous with typing. “That’s how it <em>should</em> be done. It’s faster and more efficient.” But for me, the trade-offs aren’t worth it. I’ll be sticking with pen and paper. I’ve even gone to the extent of setting up a dedicated writing desk and purchasing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm-Master-Notebook-Hardcover-Dotted/dp/B003ENUIKC?tag=joebuhlig-20">special notebook</a> for it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/guest-posting.jpeg" /><p>Over the past month I’ve made some design changes and layout alterations here on the site. Some of that was purely for aesthetics and ease of use, but it also included some back-end alterations to allow guest posting. I’ve debated this for a long time and I’m finally ready to pull the trigger.
<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>You can read the details about how to participate on the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/guest">guest posting page</a>.</strong></p>

<p>One of the best ways to expand our thinking is to explore new ideas and perspectives that may differ from our own. It forces us to formulate our own opinions on the subject. We may love the thought or think it’s trash but either way, making that decision helps us understand our own reasoning behind the subject. By allowing others to write articles for this site, we can see glimpses of how others operate and think, which broadens the perspective on productivity conveyed here.</p>

<p>This also frees up some of my own time. I really like the current posting cadence, but I’m looking to direct some of my writing time to new areas. I have a couple important projects I’m working on that I want to dedicate more time to and I know there will be more projects when those are complete. Guest posting will allow the rhythm to continue and these new areas to accelerate.</p>

<p>I can continue listing reasons why I think this is a good thing, but you get the point. There’s a lot of value that can come to all of us. So if you’re interested in sharing your thoughts and words with readers like yourself (even if you’ve never written an article before), check out the details on the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/guest">guest posting page</a>.</p>

This was my exact experience when I learned I am ADHD. It gave me words to explain the way I think and those words have given way to a deeper comprehension of how I operate.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Putting a name to it also makes it easier to connect with people in the same boat. And it makes it possible to learn what others do to take advantage of the positives and overcome the negatives. So naturally, I did some research and found that many try to eradicate it entirely. It’s seen as a disease to overcome. But you may be doing yourself an injustice by trying to delete a portion of who you are. I would rather heighten the useful aspects and downplay the detrimental. If I have an overactive mind, is there a way to allow myself to bounce from thing to thing and still accomplish my creative work? After a bit of experimentation, I’ve discovered a way to do this.</p>

<p>I can only will myself to focus on a new task for about 20 minutes - unless I’m really excited or interested in it, then it can be days before I come up for air. But when I’m not in hyperfocus mode, 20 minutes is about all I have.</p>

<p>For a long time I’ve been breaking my projects down into 15 - 20 minute tasks. My focus-ability may be why I’ve done that but I can’t say for certain. Typically, I would sit down and work on a project with the intent of completing three or four of these tasks. And I’ve had fairly good success doing so. But it’s never occurred to me that this was a bad idea. It’s what everyone else does and they seem to have a great success with it. Why shouldn’t I follow suit?</p>

<p>Learning that I am ADHD gave me the clarity I needed to explore other options. If I can naturally focus on a task for 20 minutes, what if I started a completely different type of task afterwards instead of doing more of the same? What if I alternate between coding, writing, learning, and admin every 20 minutes?</p>

<p>Bingo! It turns out that I’ve wanted to work this way all along, but I couldn’t see it. Yes, there are times when I get into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> and won’t switch. If I can focus for longer, why move on? But if I can’t focus, I don’t fight it. I switch to a different type of task and come back at the next switch off. After all, I tend the bounce quickly. Why not take advantage of it?</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts/what-to-review.jpeg" /><p>The longer I practice GTD principles, the more intentional I try to be with the time I spend updating my systems. I need my commitments to be thought through and my decisions to be made ahead of time. Knowing that I am prone to starting new projects before I have time for them leads me to a need for a recurring time of reevaluation.

<p>David Allen declares the Weekly Review a vital component of the framework. And I would agree that this once-weekly update is a <em>make it or break it</em> step to success. Without it, I would have a growing list of stalled projects that should be dropped, or at least moved to a Someday/Maybe list. But I’ve also found other levels of review to be beneficial. And those are better done at different intervals than the Weekly Review. It’s not worth my time to evaluate each context and project every morning. I would spend the vast majority of my time in reflection and never accomplish the tasks I’m reviewing.</p>

<p>The glaring question here is “What do you actually do during these reviews?” The easy thing to do is share a picture of my checklists, but that fails to explain the reasoning for the review itself. You are free to copy these, but be sure to think through your intent and understand why you are doing it before you tweak these to fit your personality. There’s potentially more harm in aimlessly going through these than in skipping them altogether.</p>

<h2 id="daily-review-20-mins">Daily Review (~20 mins)</h2>

<p>The first step in GTD is Capture. It all starts with the habit of putting tasks and ideas into an inbox. My problem is that without daily time for making a decision about each item, inboxes perpetually grow. At the same time, I struggle to jump start my day. Despite the system, I’m drawn to the most urgent or interesting thing on my mind and want to focus on it first thing in the morning. To combat this I set up the Daily Review with the purpose of clearing inboxes and creating motivation on the right task.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Process Inbox: Paper</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: Email</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: Drafts</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: Browser</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: DropBox</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: OmniFocus</li>
  <li>Review @Waiting For</li>
  <li>Review Forecast</li>
  <li>Review Calendar</li>
  <li>Review Weekly Plan</li>
  <li>Review Completed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="weekly-review-70-mins">Weekly Review (~70 mins)</h2>

<p>The core purpose of my Weekly Review is to be honest with myself and verify that I’m headed in the right direction. I’m terrible at getting a feel for this and can easily get off track in the course of an afternoon. My tendency is to put off projects that are no fun or that have a daunting next action. I need to limit the projects and tasks available to pick from. I also need to review projects that aren’t moving and ask myself why they are stalled.</p>

<p>I should note that the tasks on this checklist look deceptively simple, but they’re far from it. <em>Clear Review Perspective</em> is a 30 minute or longer task that forces me to decide if I’m going to keep the project in the active queue, put it on hold, or drop it entirely. <em>Review Stalled Projects</em> makes me look at projects I keep thinking I’ll work on but continue failing to follow through on. These two steps alone can sometimes take an hour. But if I skipped that hour of commitment reevaluation, I’ll spend weeks working on fluff that takes me nowhere.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Process Inbox: @Joe in Kitchen</li>
  <li>Clear Review Perspective</li>
  <li>Review Stalled Projects</li>
  <li>Set Weekly Plan</li>
  <li>Weekly Reflection</li>
  <li>Clean Workstation</li>
  <li>Empty Trash</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="monthly-review-30-mins">Monthly Review (~30 mins)</h2>

<p>It’s impossible to validate my direction in the Weekly Review if I don’t have goals and a mission by which these projects are guided. The simple purpose of my Monthly Review is to create guidance and help me design my days to realize these goals. I look over my Horizons of Focus and make sure I have a sense of direction for the upcoming months and years. Granted, I’m always revising this. But it’s this process of reading and altering the plan that allows me to course correct quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review 50,000</li>
  <li>Review 40,000</li>
  <li>Review 30,000</li>
  <li>Check Old Projects</li>
  <li>Evaluate Morning Ritual</li>
  <li>Evaluate Evening Ritual</li>
  <li>Evaluate Daily Schedule</li>
  <li>Evaluate Contexts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="annual-review-3-hrs">Annual Review (~3 hrs)</h2>

<p>I’ve found some value in rethinking the basic aspects of how we as a family operate once a year. Those can include insurance and savings, but they should also encompass your goals as a family or couple. And they do not need to be done all at once or alone. Involve your spouse and kids if you have them. But remember that your tolerance for this type of thinking than may be much higher (or lower) than your spouse’s. Break it up across a few weeks if you need.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Becky: Big accomplishments in the past year?</li>
  <li>Becky: Big goals for the next year?</li>
  <li>Becky: Evaluate financial state</li>
  <li>Becky: Evaluate insurance state</li>
  <li>Determine monthly goals for next year</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, this amount of review may be overkill for you. As long as your system helps you drive down the right road, you’re golden. But there are always times when we need to reference the lines on the road to keep us from hitting the ditches, and some of us need more reference points than others to stay on the road.</p>
