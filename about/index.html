<p>Byoolig. My last name. That’s how you say it. I know that’s the main reason you came to this page. </p>

<p>My career in a nut: I work in agriculture. Having grown up on a farm in Missouri, it’s in my blood. I’ve worked in soybean seed research; I’ve worked in data analysis in corporate; I transitioned to web application development in corporate and now work from home dreaming up and creating new technologies.</p>

<p>Talk about a variance in work environments. Bean field → office → cubicle nation → family room.</p>

<p>I’m a fan of woodworking, anything Apple, coffee (I’m an addict), DIY projects around the house, and anything that involves my family. That’s where the bulk of my elusive free time is spent.</p>

<p>The best way to directly contact me is to <a href="mailto:joe@joebuhlig.com">send me an email</a>. Otherwise, you can find me at any of the sites in the right-hand corner of the navigation bar above.</p>
