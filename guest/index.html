<p>Without some guidelines, things can get out of hand quickly. Here are the keys to keep in mind when developing your idea for a guest article.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep it original</strong></li>
<p>Make sure the article you're thinking about isn't a repost. I'll only accept new material.</p>
<li><strong>On topic</strong></li>
<p>Read through some of the posts here if you haven't already. That's the best way to ensure you're on the right track.</p>
<li><strong>Not an ad</strong></li>
<p>This should go without saying but this isn't a place to advertise your thing. Use your site for that.</p>
<li><strong>Be authentic</strong></li>
<p>Let's hear your unique perspective. Use your voice and your thoughts.</p>
</ol>
<p>If you feel as though your idea for an article can hit these, go ahead and submit your idea to me via a <a href="https://productivityguild.com/users/joebuhlig">private message on the Productivity Guild</a>.</p>
