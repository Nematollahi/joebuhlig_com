<p>Without some guidelines, things can get out of hand quickly. Here are the keys to keep in mind when developing your idea for a guest article.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep it original</strong></li>
<p>Make sure the article you're thinking about isn't a repost. I'll only accept new material.</p>
<li><strong>On topic</strong></li>
<p>Read through some of the posts here if you haven't already. That's the best way to ensure you're on the right track.</p>
<li><strong>Not an ad</strong></li>
<p>This should go without saying but this isn't a place to advertise your thing. Use your site for that.</p>
<li><strong>Be authentic</strong></li>
<p>Let's hear your unique perspective. Use your voice and your thoughts.</p>
</ol>
<p>If you feel as though your idea for an article can hit these, go ahead and submit it below. If you have more than one idea, please submit the form separately for each.</p>
