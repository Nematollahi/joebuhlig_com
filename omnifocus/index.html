<p>There are a number of how-to articles and resources for OmniFocus. I even write a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tag/omnifocus/">bunch of them</a>. This book won't help you learn how to use it.</p>

<p>That's right. It won't help. But if you're looking for a book to help you understand the nuances of OmniFocus and how to think about your setup, this is for you. My goal is to help you understand how I work and how I set up OmniFocus to help me get work done. And by seeing the connection between my setup and how my brain works, you should find correlations in your own ways of working that you can incorporate into your setup.</p>

<p>And you should know that I'm not going to show you the right way to set up OmniFocus. There's not one. But I will help you figure out how to set it up for you. We all work differently and the tools we use to support our work should complement it. That's what this is about - working with OmniFocus.</p>
